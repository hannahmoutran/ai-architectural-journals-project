SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS
JULY, 1929

ENTRANCE DETAIL, MILLS B. LANE HOUSE, SAVANNAH, GA.

The addition to the north side occupies the site of the former garden, while the ugly cornices over the windows were added in late years.

In the restoration in the new building, every exterior dimension and detail was duplicated to the smallest fraction of an inch. In the rebuilding of the main spiral stairway, fragments of the original were on the walls and the first floor, the outlines of which were all carefully followed. The iron work is an exact replica and every slab of marble in the portico was carefully measured and reproduced. One of the greatest problems was the restoration of the stucco to imitate the original. Analysis of the original showed that it was made of lime and sand, the lime being procured from the pulverizing of oyster shells. The sand was of an unusual pearly color. In the restoration this old “Tabby” was carefully produced so as to obtain the original color and texture.

The house is now occupied by Mr. William Murphey, the president of the Citizens & Southern Bank.
