The Finger-Cling
Patented Bond Anchor for Brick Walls
THE Finger-Cling bonds every course, including the outside course, to the joists and frame of the building. It fits flat between courses. Note how the fingers cling to the heart of the wall. Mortar hardens in the loops, making the bond part of the wall. The Finger-Cling bond is light and easily handled, but has enormous tensile strength, being made of fine steel. Made flat and with right angle twist, so that they may be used on the top or sides of joists.
Much cheaper than any other bond, and more effective, because they bond every course. Specified by leading architects; used by best builders. Write for list of users, prices, and terms.

DAMP-PROOFING
PERCOPROOF COMPOUND
Makes Foundations Impervious to Moisture
Eight Thousand Gallons of Percoproof were used for waterproofing the Cincinnati General Hospital Buildings
APPLIED with a brush direct to foundation walls, concrete construction, masonry, or stucco surfaces, Percoproof forms an unbroken, elastic facing that fills every pore and crack and prevents all seepage and moisture from entering. Unlike ordinary damp-proofing compounds, Percoproof contains no oil and does not become brittle. It comes ready for use and is equally satisfactory in all climates and at all seasons. Write for our damp-proofing booklet.
