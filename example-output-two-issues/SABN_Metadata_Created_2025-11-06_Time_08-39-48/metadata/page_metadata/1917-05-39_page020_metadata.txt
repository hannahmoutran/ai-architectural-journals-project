The Economy is in great demand. Hundreds of homes have installed them this winter. Write today for catalogue and complete details.

Safety, Simplicity and Economy
These are the basic principles of scientific and practical building construction today. The safe column must comply strictly with the building laws. It should transmit loads in a direct line, doing away with shearing strains. It should be easy to handle.
KEYSTONE
Cast Iron Columns
Comply with these requirements and offer you many new and interesting features. They are equipped with the Keystone Combination Column Cap, which is self centering with due prevention against eccentric loading. Made with one, two, three and four-way brackets. The lugs are easily altered to suit beams of different depths. The illustration above shows a two-way bracket with lugs to accommodate beams of different depths.
