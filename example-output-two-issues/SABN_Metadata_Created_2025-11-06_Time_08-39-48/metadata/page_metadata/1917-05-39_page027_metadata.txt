The Work of Henry Hering

AMERICAN sculpture with the figure of Rodin hovering over it, an evil genius, is as though it had been dipped in an acid that only age could rub off. There have been so many monumental figures in art, but no single, contemporary figure of any period so enormous as that of the great Frenchman. He is, as I have said elsewhere, a god or a monster. The great mass of sculptors either profit from the radiation of his light or are lost in the darkness of his shadow, writes Guy Pene du Bois in The Architectural Record.

''Diana''—A Bronze Profile—By Henry Hering, Sculptor.

Rodin with the world, I am inclined to believe, is a realist. That may be because the present day interest in dollars is greater than the present day interest in art. Indeed it is the art market, the glamour of the fabulous sums spent in it, rather than the art product, that creates talk, excitement, admiration, envy among the people.

Now unless art takes the reins and tugs on them one way or another we are going to be realists—that is, we are going to take life as it comes and comment upon it with all the literal truth of which we are capable. Not because the world is without natural idealists and symbolists, men with intuitive prejudices who would follow a path blindfolded despite temptations placed in a million by-ways, but because the vaster world with eyes glued on gold follows the practical man who may lure it with enough of the stuff that glitters. The practical collector of gold is a realist.

Place ideals instead of dollars, which for the simplification of the argument is not an ideal, on the pedestal, and immediately the heads of artists, who are individuals, will bob up definitely above the vortex; idealism becomes a buffer to realism; symbolism steals a little of the fire of literalism.

It is true that nothing lives that is not truthful, and likewise true that the range of truth is so vast that one end of it must seem very great truth and the other end very great falsehood. Now the modern realist who sees in truth an obvious theme are likely to call the idealist a liar, forgetting that truth, which is sincerity, lives in every man’s individual vision.

Henry Hering, the sculptor, whom this article concerns, is not a realist, not a follower of Rodin, strange for the day, and one of the most sincere of the men here who feel that they have something within themselves worth giving out to the world. He was born in New York City in 1874. He began his studies at Cooper Union, worked for eight years with Martini and for eight years with Augustus Saint Gaudens. The latter connection was broken only with the sculptor’s death.

It would be futile and rather foolish to say that he had retained nothing of the teaching of these men, that he had discarded, with a shake of the shoulders, the veil thrown over every sincere student and stood forth an individual linked to no other individual by any trend of thought or any method of expression. He is Saint Gaudens over again, the workman and, in many little delicacies of conception, the artist. Here the influence may be said to rest and through it and above it stands Hering the individual, with his own grip on thought. A very distinct point should be made of this because it would be a very easy and a very natural thing to place him as a pupil of Saint Gaudens, in accordance with the tradition of the pupil and the master, and to let it go at that, and because I fear that it would be as great a mistake as to say all Republicans and all Democrats and all Socialists were sheep or that every soldier in a company was like his captain.

Hering works quite alone and rarely exhibits. In this he resembles the older sculptors whose work became familiar to the public only after it was placed in a public building or square or park a finished commission. He has made an ideal of dignity
