SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS
JULY, 1929

yond the forest, the lodge house is seen amid a ca- thedral of green and gray. The whitewashed brick walls and graceful columns are strongly contrasted with the wonderful old live oaks, magnolias and camellias.

Approaching the house the road takes a wide bend, giving the visitor a full picture of the winding river beyond the house, the golden marsh land and pine woods across the stream. The superintendents' cottage, stables and kennels add to its completeness. The house is located almost on the exact spot, where some two hundred years ago one of the earliest man- sions was erected. Nothing remained of the old home but the foundations, composed of huge Eng- lish brick used as ballast no doubt for sailing vessels in the earlier days.

With such a background the architect's problem of selecting a style for Mr. Dominick's lodge house was already determined. The house is in that style of Colonial and Georgian Architecture so character- istic of the Southeastern States in the early days. Simple and sturdy lines depending entirely on mass and proportion for its impressive effect. The main portion consists of the two-story porch, entrance hall, dining room and living room with an open terrace on the river side. On the second floor in the center are the owner's bed rooms. There are two subordi- nate wings, one houses the guests while the other wing is taken up with the service. These wings are placed at such angles that sunlight can be had to the maximum advantage in every room.

Within the house there is an atmosphere of sim- plicity, a feeling of quiet and restfulness, freedom from cares and the responsibility of many servants. A simple Colonial stairway is the feature of the wide hall extending through from porch to terrace. The living room is most pleasing with its low ceiling, deep set windows and attractive mantel with book shelves on either side. Huge bricks from the foun- dation of the house have been effectively used for mantel facings in all rooms. The dining room, gun room and bed rooms are all unpretentious, comfort- able and livable. Such rooms you always found in the fine old houses erected in those good old days when servants were no problem and prohibition no issue.
