Wolverine Closets
Greatest sanitary invention ever offered village communities. And it’s not an experiment. It has been proven successful in thousands of homes, schools, factories, churches, etc.

A contractor can sell this closet by merely suggesting it and describing its obvious advantages over the demoralizing unhealthy out-houses.

We guarantee this closet to be absolutely satisfactory in every way; and can make an attractive offer to one reliable builder in every town to act as our agent. The closet is guaranteed. You merely suggest it, and secure a good profit on every sale.

Now is the time to write for our proposition before the winter sets in. Wolverine Closets overcome the dread of winter.
