SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

ONE REVOLUTION PER MINUTE of the
Kingwelton Rotary Air Washers
requires but one horsepower per 50,000 cubic feet of air supplied per minute to the building. Other volumes in proportion. This makes the cost of operation 9/10 LESS than the same service performed by other washers.
Made to fit any reasonable location and to purify any desired volume of air; 99% of the impurities removed.
