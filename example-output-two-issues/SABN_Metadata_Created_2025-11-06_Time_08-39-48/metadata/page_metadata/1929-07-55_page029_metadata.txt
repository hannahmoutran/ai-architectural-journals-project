House of Gilman Prichard, Augusta, Ga.
By E. Lynn Drummond

MANY years ago when Augusta's residential district was that section now known as down town, long before winter resort hotels or a winter colony were thought of, a number of her wealthier citizens built summer cottages on the sand hill to the west to escape the heat of the valley. Many of these cottages still stand, surrounded by beautiful gardens and quaint picket fences, have been modernized, kept up, and are now the center of the city's fashionable life. The type has an atmosphere of its own, an atmosphere of hospitality, and so when the Gilman Prichards of Concord, Mass., bought a little patch of wooded land on Cumming Street just back of Milledge Road and named it "The Woodlot," this type was selected as the inspiration for the new house.
