To Encourage More Home Building

THE nation-wide “Buy a Home” campaign that is being agitated by the executive committee of the National Association of Real Estate Boards promises to create additional outlets of lumber consumption that should draw the keenest interest of lumbermen. While the real estate men are no doubt actuated by their common desire to emphasize in the most impressive manner possible the growing values of realty, no development of land values can be accelerated without the improvements that are conferred through building activities.

The preparations made by the national association embrace direct home booming practically in every community in the country, and the individual members of the committee are located at the most desirable and convenient points. For the information of the lumbermen who will desire to identify themselves with this movement the names of the members of the executive committee are given here:

Hill Ferguson, of Birmingham, Ala., chairman; J. E. Morris, of Indianapolis, Ind.; Paul C. Murphy, of Portland, Ore.; I. F. Eppich, of Denver, Colo., and John S. Leslie, of Sharon, Pa. In drawing attention to the fact that the locations of the members are in the most promising parts of the country for the movement that is being advocated, the information is added that the territory which will no doubt be covered thoroughly by each member of the executive committee—with the assistance of the local realty boards—is particularly apt to respond quickly to the general publicity that will be used.

Before this countrywide campaign for the individual ownership of homes was started, similar movements were successfully carried out in large cities such as Birmingham, Ala.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Denver, Colo., etc., and proved to be remarkably effective in stimulating real estate purchases. To a great extent, lumber retailers in the cities here named also profited because there was a good sized increase in the demand for buildings, especially of wooden construction. The details of the “Buy a Home” campaign are as follows:

1. Let the local Board endorse the movement and fix the dates, and appoint a committee of five to carry out the campaign. Get good, live committeemen who have enterprising and original ideas. The Board should determine the amount it wants to spend on this campaign. A very creditable one can be put on for $100.00. If there is no real estate board in your city, call an informal meeting of the real estate men and get them organized at least long enough to put on this campaign.

2. Invite the local ad club, or if they are not organized, invite the ad men individually, to attend a joint meeting with the real estate men—or arrange for a joint luncheon to talk matters over. Explain to the ad men that there is no real prosperity in this country unless real estate is active, and that the architects, contractors, material men and furniture, wall paper, paint, plumbing and other such dealers are just as much interested in “Buy a Home” as are the real estate men. The ad men will help you wonderfully in this campaign.

3. Have the whole committee, or a good subcommittee, go before the local Boards of Education, for the city and county, or the City or County Superintendents of Education, and urge them to have all the children in the public schools engage in some sort of contest in composition writing during or just before the “Buy a Home” campaign in May—such compositions to emphasize the desirability of home ownership. Of course the object of this is to educate the child along proper lines, and also to start the folks at home to thinking about Buying a Home.

4. Have a local print shop get out several hundred yellow cards 14 inches wide and 22 inches tall with the phrase “Buy a Home” printed in red at the top of the card—“Buy” on the first line and “A Home” on the second line. These letters should be about 3 inches tall, and the two lines should take up the upper 9 inches of the card, leaving the lower 13 inches blank. Arrange with a local sign painter to visit the various merchants and print on the bottom of the card in black ink, some phrase applicable to the merchant’s own business—for instance: “Buy a Home and We’ll Stock the Pantry”—“and start a garden in the back yard”—“and we’ll give it that cozy look”—“and let us paper the walls”—“and we’ll supply the baby carriage”—“if you have the money; if not, get ready to buy a home by starting a savings account”—“and put your savings in a diamond”—“with the money you save trading at Woodworth’s”. You will find that the merchants show great ingenuity in getting up phrases to fit their
