40 SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

ive buildings, but very often produce defective ones. No well-known building was ever done by a contractor-builder alone. The architect was there as counsel for both owner and contractor from the very beginning until the structure was finished and in every respect ready for the purpose intended.

Through him you have the means of checking materials, whether provided as specified. If you have ever employed an architect you found that the plans which he prepared showed every detail of construction—every outlet for electricity, water, steam, etc., making it possible to get a group of contractors to give you closer and more definite bids, because it is only on plans showing every detail and full conditions that contractors can bid without guessing.

You found to your surprise that the architect furnished in addition to the working drawings and specifications, in spite of his small fee, a complete set of mechanical equipment drawings, showing the lines of all pipes for heating, lighting, ventilation, etc., also a complete set of engineering drawings, showing the location of every steel rod and every rivet hole for truss work.

Furthermore, you found that every moulding and ornamental feature, both exterior and interior, was shown in full size drawings; that the interior had an individuality of finish which was pleasingly commented upon by everyone who entered the building; that the exterior had a distinct attractiveness which drew the attention of passers by, thereby becoming a self-advertiser and giving you a peculiar sense of pride in its ownership.

You found that the steam heating system did not have to be tampered with, nor the plumbing, nor the wiring, as they all worked perfectly, and as a consequence of employing an architect the building was complete, the arrangement of every detail of the plans fully up to your expectations, and the structure recognized by your tenants as being exceptionally convenient and attractive; that they took pride in living in it and speaking favorably of it to their friends—the most effective form of advertising there is.

Has Professional Pride.

You found the architect a very honest fellow, who stood in a neutral position between you as owner and the contractor, to see to it that the structure was honestly, economically and expeditiously built; that when a just and businesslike contract was made no step was omitted nor taken with undue haste in the orderly procedure throughout this most complicated of all undertakings, the planning and construction of an effective building.

Finally, Mr. Builder, you found by employing an architect who has professional pride in carrying out his part of the enterprise, that satisfactory results were obtained not only for yourself as owner, but for your contractor as well; that he treated both in a thoroughly professional manner, just as your doctor or your lawyer would do; that he refused to compete in the matter of his fee with other architects, a practice which would lead to demoralizing results in the form of imperfect service for which in the long run the public would pay, since the public has no way of gaining a knowledge of the profession, nor of informing itself as to what constitutes complete professional service with respect to the architect, and that he was worth the customary fee, if not many times more than that amount.

A Six Hundred Car Garage.

In a giant garage just constructed in New York City, the exasperating delays often encountered in getting cars into or out of the aisle are eliminated, because the garage has no elevators and the cars are automatically spaced on the floors in such a manner that there is sufficient room for each one to run out into the aisle without disturbing the others.

Inclined concrete ramps take the place of elevators, each ramp being twenty feet wide, says the Popular Science Monthly. They are arranged so that one line of cars goes up while another line is coming down. There is a concrete curb in the center of each ramp, to restrict the lines of cars to separate paths, so as to prevent collisions between cars passing in opposite directions. Besides being a great convenience to the individual automobile owners, these two-way ramps will effect a saving of approximately $18,250 in annual overhead expense for the garage owner. The ramps from floor to floor of the four-story structure take up the same amount of room as elevators but the cost of building them is the only expense connected with them. It costs nothing to operate them when once built. The designer of the garage, H. B. Mulliken, of New York City, has calculated that the cost of each elevator trip is ten cents and that the average daily number of cars going up and down would be two hundred and fifty, making five hundred trips in all.

An Unbreakable Window Glass.

A new glass, transparent, tough and strong, which a 22-caliber bullet cannot penetrate and a brick cannot shatter, is stated by Popular Science Monthly to have recently been invented. The secret of its strength is said to be a sheet of white, transparent celluloid, twenty one-thousandths of an inch thick, placed between two pieces of glass. The glass and celluloid are welded together under high temperature and tremendous pressure, the result being a solid sheet possessing the transparency of the best plate glass and the strength of a sheet of metal.
