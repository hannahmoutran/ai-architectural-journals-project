The Original Concrete Waterproofing
(INTEGRAL METHOD)

CIRCUIT Judge Baker, U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in delivering the opinion of the Court, re. Newberry (Medusa Waterproofing) patent said:

"His patent is clear. Inexpert workers in concrete are plainly told how to achieve the new results in the best way. And in the light of this record we believe he is to be credited with an invention of a very high order."

Contractors and builders will find our literature on the Waterproofing subject very interesting and valuable.

Having been a carpenter for years and having seen the need of a sharp and true running saw, I have spent much time and money in perfecting a saw for saw filing.

We are now glad to have the pleasure of presenting to the public a machine that takes no expert to use, but any one can file a saw absolutely perfect with from 4 to 12 teeth to the inch and every tooth will be the exact set. So that every one will have a perfect saw that uses our machine.

Write for descriptive circular and price list.
