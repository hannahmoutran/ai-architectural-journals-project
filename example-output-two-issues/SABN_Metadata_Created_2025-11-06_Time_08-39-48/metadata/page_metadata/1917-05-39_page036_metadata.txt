Demand for Bathtubs and Plumbing Supplies in Bogota.

The consulate at Barranquilla, Colombia, is advised that there is a large number of houses being built or remodeled continually in Bogota and that there is a good demand for all kinds of modern plumbing fixtures, bathtubs, and steam and hot-water fittings, and an opportunity for an American plumbing shop with trained men. It is reported that the native plumbers do not give satisfaction, probably due to the absence of modern methods, and that an American establishment with an attractive showroom of modern fixtures would doubtless meet with success.

(The consul transmitted the name of a person in Bogota with whom interested persons may correspond, the address of whom can be obtained at the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce or its district or co-operative offices. Refer to file No. 8578.3)

Plans of Metal Lath Association.

Announcement has just been made by the Publicity Bureau of the Associated Metal Lath Manufacturers that their offices have been moved from Chicago to Room 901 Swetland† Building, Cleveland, Ohio, and that Zenas W. Carter, formerly of Boston, has been appointed Commissioner, to supervise all their publicity, promotion and investigation from the Cleveland office.

Mr. Zenas W. Carter has been manager for manufacturers’ associations for the past ten years, directing co-operative publicity and promotion work between manufacturers, distributors and consumers. He was the first General Secretary of the Electric Development Association when it was incorporated in New England, and he has managed the publicity and field promotion and investigation work of the Granite Paving Block Manufacturers’ Association of the United States since their organization two and a half years ago.

Among the plans of the Metal Lath Association which are yet in the embryo is a co-operative national campaign of publicity which will be developed by the Council of Advertising Managers of the member companies, which Council is an active part of the Publicity Bureau of the Manufacturers’ organization, although the Publicity Bureau proper includes officials and sales managers of the companies interested. Their plans cover a series of extensive and exhaustive tests of the fire resistance properties of metal lath, its use in fire retarding construction, the exploitation to architects and the public of the saving in space which can be effected through the use of this material, its vermin and rodent proofness; investigation and assistance in the revision of building codes of cities so that metal lath will receive its proper recognition by city officials and engineers, and a co-operative movement in the distributing centers of the United States seeking to develop co-operative promotion work on the part of the jobbers and large distributors of metal lath.

The Advertising Managers who comprise the Advertising Council of the Publicity Bureau of the Associated Metal Lath Manufacturers are:

Mr. C. O. Powell, president, Northwestern Expanded Metal Company.
Mr. S. E. Feeheimer, Trussed Concrete Steel Company.
Mr. R. M. Nicholson, Berger Manufacturing Company.
Mr. C. M. Stewart, Consolidated Expanded Metal Companies.
Mr. L. E. Fisher, General Fireproofing Company.
Mr. L. J. Rouleau, Penn Metal Company.
Mr. H. F. Ericksen, Milwaukee Corrugating Company.
Mr. Wm. Geo. Lane, secretary, The Bostwick Steel Lath Company.
Mr. Zenas W. Carter, Commissioner.

The Julian Armstrong Bureau of Related Industries will continue its special work for the Associated Metal Lath Manufacturers, and Mr. Walter L. Weeden, of Worcester, Massachusetts, has succeeded Mr. Carter, as field secretary of the Granite Paving Block Manufacturers’ Association, of Boston.

Non-Combustible Roofing.

A non-combustible roofing measure has been approved by the city council of Meridian, Miss. It provides that after June 1, all new houses and those re-covered shall be covered with non-combustible material. It is provided that where repairs are desired for existing roofs after June 1, permits will be granted if they are 50 per cent good. New buildings and new roofs are permitted to have wooden rafters and sheeting.
