SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

Crumb’s New Cattle Stanchion.
Crumb’s Warriner Patent Chain Hanging Cattle Stanchion, manufactured by Wallace B. Crumb, at Forestville, Conn., are the best stanchions of this type manufactured. It is fully covered by patents in both United States and Canada.
They have recently improved the form of the bolt used in fastening the frame together. In the sectional drawing shown in their ad the bolts are continuous, passing entirely through the frame and secured on the outside by nuts which effectually prevent any racking or twisting. This improvement renders Crumb’s Stanchion an even more effective and durable device than heretofore, although it has always possessed these qualities to an admirable degree.
If you are contemplating the erection of new barns or the refitting of your present stables, by all means investigate this fastener before purchasing. If you have been getting along with an inconvenient old style affair, it will be to your interest to use Crumb’s Stanchion in the place of those you now have. You will find it will greatly add to your own convenience, be a considerable saving in time and labor, and materially add to your income by increasing the comfort and cleanliness of your cattle, thereby increasing the flow of milk.

Modern Water Closets.
The modern architect or builder knows that through the selection of the materials for his contract, that it is either helping to make or break his reputation. Usually the low costing article receives more attention and use than costlier merchandise. An illustration of this point is in a comparison of water closets against the higher priced marble surroundings.
Invariably the water closet will receive more use than the marble, its function is to give service and to afford better sanitary methods for the modern construction.

The unsuccessful operation of the gravity flushing closets, both from the standpoint of sanitary conditions, due to insufficient water pressure for the proper cleansing of the bowl, and the various methods of control resulting in a noisy, troublesome combination prompted Mr. H. C. Bowlus, founder of the Bowlus Mfg. Co., of Springfield, Ohio, to conceive the Bowlus “Famous” and “Jewel” flush valves.
The “Famous” direct flush meter, is designed primarily to render entire satisfaction and service. It is so designed as to eliminate all noises, troubles and other disadvantages.
The “Famous” has an adjustable end base that can be guaged to throw any amount of water that is desired to a flush, depending entirely upon the requirements of the building owner. This valve has been on the market for the past several years and is now entering into what promises to be one of the most successful years in its history. This valve is also designed so as to fit any manufacture bowl. This is for the purpose of replacements of the “Famous” on remodeling contracts. As there are instances where the old bowls can be fitted with this valve and made to give many years more service. A one inch water supply is all that is required for the “Famous” and it roughs in at nine or more inches.
The Bowlus Company, also manufacture the “Jewel” compression tank water closets, which have been extensively used in all parts of the world. This combination has proven very popular as a school, factory or public service closet.
Both combinations are fully guaranteed for five years. Should any reader desire information they may obtain same by addressing the Bowlus Manufacturing Co., Springfield, Ohio, and giving credit to this publication.
Among the water closet installations made in this territory are the following: Greer, S. C., schools; Great Falls, S. C., Republic Cotton Mills; Parkersburg, W. Va., Masonic Temple; Glenpool, Okla., schools; Boyles, Ala., High Schools; Birmingham, Ala., Atlanta, Ga., schools; Lavonia, Ga., courthouse; Winder, Ga., Jefferson, Ga., schools; Perry, Fla., St. Augustine, Fla., Houston, Texas, Port Arthur, Texas, Arthur, Texas, schools, and many southern states.
