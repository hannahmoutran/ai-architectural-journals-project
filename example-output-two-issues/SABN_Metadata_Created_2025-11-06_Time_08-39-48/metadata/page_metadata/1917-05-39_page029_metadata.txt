SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

During this time he was forced to push his wit to the extreme of effort in almost every direction. Mr. Freeman, being a typical New Englander, feared the thing that he could not understand, feared that possibly a fortune was to be made from settlers, who, strangers in a strange wilderness, became conquerers of it.

The theme of this work Hering carried out in a portrait bust of Augustus Saint Gaudens finished just previous to that great American's death, and never publicly exhibited. This Saint Gaudens' bust indeed, as a tribute to the famous artist, is unquestionably valuable. In the Metropolitan Museum of Art are two portraits of Saint Gaudens, one by mula, bad. I imagine that realists finding that the classic spirit regulated the realism would discover an ideal in it and cry falsehood. Mr. Hering, as a matter of fact, is too truthful to deny his eyes as the Academicians do and too sincere or too truthful to deny the ideal of beauty, which with him, as with any man, must color his sight.

I believe that this ideal in Hering is dignity. A portrait bust of John Freeman, a New England farmer, which he showed to me recently in his studio, is to me the most direct expression, at least the most obvious expression of himself, or of his art, if you prefer it, that I can call to mind.

That Hering himself considered the execution of it important is certain. He spent three years getting the old farmer, who is past eighty, to pose for him.

'L'Allegro'—A Bronze by Henry Hering.

The right image depicts 'Diana', a nude figure holding a spear, poised as if in motion. The text is arranged in columns around the images, with a header at the top reading 'SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS'. The page number '31' is located at the top right corner. The text discusses the themes and execution of Hering's work, with references to other artists and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
