HEATING and VENTILATING
D-I

Now Ready for You

HERE, just off the press, is our comprehensive new catalog, picturing and describing in full detail

D-I
Heating and Ventilating Specialties
For Schools, Hospitals, and Other Public Buildings

D-I Specialties have won the unqualified endorsement of architects and heating engineers, and perform faithfully the following important functions:

1. They introduce from without the building a sufficient quantity of pure fresh air to meet all requirements:
2. They warm this air in the course of its admission.
3. They automatically give it the proper degree of humidity---without attention whatsoever on the part of the operating engineer.
4. They diffuse this pure, warm, humidified air to every nook and corner of the room, without drafts.

Our catalog explains in detail how D-I Specialties perform these functions, and why the D-I system is the most efficient and most economical ever devised. It also contains tables and extensive data on temperatures, air changes, evaporation, and percentages of humidity conducive to good health and efficiency, and other valuable reference data. A copy will be sent gladly to any architect or heating engineer who requests it.
