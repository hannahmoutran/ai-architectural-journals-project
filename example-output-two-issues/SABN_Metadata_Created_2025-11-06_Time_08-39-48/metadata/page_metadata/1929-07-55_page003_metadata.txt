The Editor's Annotations
IS YOUR WORK WORTH MORE THAN 10%?

ALMOST over night there has arisen along the architectural horizon of the South a faint but easily perceptible cloud, not sufficient within itself perhaps to cause any alarm or materially affect the welfare of southern architects. However, if the velocity of the wind should increase it is likely that a situation will come up whereby the whole fabric of professional ethics in the matter of fees for architectural service might have to undergo a rather painful operation. Unless some step is taken before many moons have passed over southern skies to prevent this condition coming to pass, we venture the assertion that the dark cloud will be over us long before we are safely entrenched within our storm cellars.

Dame rumor has been whispering into our editorial ear quite persistently recently of foreign architects coming into the South and grabbing off big commissions that rightly belonged to southern architects, and what's more we are given to understand their clients are boasting of the fact that they had to pay their architect more than ten per cent. This does not sound so good to say the least, when we happen to know that about the best an architect practising in the South can do is six to eight per cent on commercial work and eight to ten per cent on residential jobs.

There may be a few architects scattered throughout the country who are practising architecture purely for the love of it but you can count them on your two hands and eliminate the thumbs altogether. This leads us to remark that if these fellows can come South from the East and West and do their work just as satisfactorily as southern men can do and still pull a higher commission fee from their clients then more power to them. Our observation over a period of years is quite convincing that the work done by local architects in cities throughout the South stacks up equally as well, and in more cases than not, better than work done by foreign men when you come right down to brass tacks and make comparisons in cost and satisfactory performance of the completed buildings. Then, we would like to know why some sophisticated southern people will go out of their way to submerge themselves to a building they have to pay a higher per cent on when the same work can be done for less than ten per cent? There seems to us to be three answers to this question—either southern architects are not receiving a fair price for their services or foreign architects are being overpaid—the third answer might insult the intelligence of somebody's client so we will refrain from making further comment.

There is a great amount of outside capital being invested in the South today and perhaps it is natural that architects from the East and West where these investing organizations have their home office should be given first consideration and entrusted with the design, plan and erection of their buildings in the South. We wonder some time if these capitalists really do consider the economic factor involved in engaging the service of an architectural office which is entirely unfamiliar with climatic conditions, the labor situation and existing material prices in the South. We are firmly convinced from certain experiences which have been brought to our attention that should a comparison be made of the ability of southern architects and that of architects from other sections to produce a given building with a given sum of money, the southern men would stand out head and shoulders above their foreign brothers. This is no reflection on the architects from the East or West but it is a simple matter of being familiar with certain conditions that do in reality influence to a great degree the actual cost of the finished structure.

Why is it that quite often when an eastern or western architect secures a job in the South a southern architect or architectural firm is named an associate? It is because that client or that architect realizes that it is good economy to do so. We happen to know of an instance where the southern associate insisted on changing the specifications by his eastern colleague and by doing so saved the client twenty thousand dollars on a single item. We also know of several cases where the architect requested his southern associate to write the specifications acknowledging that he had no earthly idea as to how it should be done to meet certain conditions that existed here in the South. And mind you these instances which we have cited are shortcomings of two of the leading architects in the East. It is sad but true that the associate architects on these works received only two per cent while the architect up East collected a very nice four per cent.

If foreign architects can secure a larger per cent for their service here in the South it looks like southern architects could do likewise. It's about time southern architects were acting as architects and not associates on the big work.
