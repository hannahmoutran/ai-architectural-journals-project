Gentlemen:
Permit me to say a word in behalf of the CLIMAX FURNACES. I may, however, I wish to say that I have used different and sundry furnaces in the different one of the parsonages and churches I have occupied during the past 30 years, and a sum of $2,500 or $3,000 worth of furnaces were purchased and installed.

But never, of all, did we get the comfort and satisfaction as from the CLIMAX. All we had to do was to fill the magazine and the stove took care of itself. It was the best $35 investment I ever made.

I wish to thank you for your promptness and honesty.
Yours truly,
H. W. THORESEN, Minister.
