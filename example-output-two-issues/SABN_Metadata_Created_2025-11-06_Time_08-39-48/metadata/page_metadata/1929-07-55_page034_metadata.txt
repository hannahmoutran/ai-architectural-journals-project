70 SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS JULY, 1929

On the site, almost hidden by the trees stood a little four-room cottage. Some say it was all of a hundred years old. This cottage was made the service portion of the house, the master’s portion being built in front of it. The two buildings were joined by two covered passages and the space thus inclosed was turned into an inside garden or outdoor living room.

The old cottage type presented a difficulty, in that the low sweeping roof allowed insufficient space for second story bedrooms, so while the general detail was adhered to, the roof was given the Dutch gambrel form, not out of harmony at all, for curiously enough, a number of old Augusta houses show a strong Dutch influence.

In the design of the house the trees were made a vital part of the composition. At one point a wall of one of the connecting passages has been deliberately built around a large oak, the same thing happens twice at the front terrace wall, while another tree, with a bench around it, grows up through the east terrace pavement. It was necessary to remove only two trees, both small ones.

Though in general the freshly painted, kept up appearance of the old cottage type has been preserved, the walls of the inner court show an interesting treatment best described as antique: whitewashed brick. Genuine old brick were used, and the whitewash was not paint, but real whitewash, made durable by the addition of salt, alum, and molasses. Mortar joints were hosed down while green, lightly at the top, more toward the bottom, washed back in some cases as much as an inch. The whitewash was applied thick. When still wet it was stained with dry color, beginning at the ground, gradually fading out several feet up; the color, raw and burnt sienna, burnt umber and light blue, applied with a wide brush and blended out to simulate weather stains. After about half an hour the wall was sprayed with a hose till patches of the half set whitewash fell away, showing the brick. The spraying was heaviest near the ground. The whole operation was repeated several times, the final effect being that of a wall that had been whitewashed, weatherbeaten, whitewashed again, again weatherbeaten, and so on through the years.

In the treatment of the interior authentic Colonial mouldings and detail were used throughout. Mr. Prichard’s study is 17th century, the walls all of beaded boards stained to simulate old unfinished wood. The living and dining rooms are of a later period, the woodwork enameled in soft ivory and the walls papered. There are no ceiling fixtures. All the lighting is by floor lamps, and a few old-fashioned sconces.
