34 SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

A less impressionistic nature would have accepted the petty jealousies which it created without being disturbed, but Engelmann, in his impulsive excitement, left the Academy, and went to Florence. Here he worked with Hildebrandt until the latter left Florence, but not before he had made lasting impressions upon Engelmann.

Then the young sculptor met with Boecklein, a mature artist of many years, who for a long time had not used any model, carrying nature in his head and hand; he explained his version of plastic art and advised the young artist to study the antique, and to dispense with his model. Engelmann began this style of work before he had made a sufficient study of nature to be able to proceed without a model, with the result that his work was rejected by the jury in Munich.

Just at this time, a German artist traveling through Florence, advised him to go to Paris, whither he went in 1896. After a short time at the Julian Academy he retired, depending upon his own resources to work out the way which no teacher could enlighten for him.

Soon he succumbs to a new influence and Hildebrandt and Italy are entirely forgotten: in their place come Rude and Carpeaux and the younger artists, Dubois, Mercie and Damot. Paris enthuses over these, and Engelmann finds in them many things that appeal to him, such as realism in detail of form and impression and many plastic singularities. Engelmann's work during this period were named "Drowned," "A Condemned One," etc., and one finds them worthy of the exhibits at Champ de Mars.

The artist, however, did not find for himself full satisfaction at Paris and he began to think of Berlin and the sculptor Begas.

In 1898 he went to Berlin and still after the style of his Paris work, completed "The Loving Couple," "The Rebel" and "Pelleas and Melisande." Then
