SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

Poured Blocks are Good Blocks
MacArthur Blocks are poured blocks

Why shouldn’t the concrete in a building block be of just as high quality as the concrete in a poured foundation for a building? Our system of manufacture is founded on the theory that concrete for a building block should be of the highest possible quality—that means that it should have sufficient moisture to make it “pour.”

MacArthur blocks are poured in low-cost metal molds. When they have hardened sufficiently, they are released and stored for aging. When they have cured, they are flint-hard and ring when struck with a hammer.

MacArthur metal molds for molding MacArthur blocks are easily assembled and easily cleaned. You can start with a few molds and add to your equipment as your business grows.

You will have no competition for your product. Architects and Builders will specify your blocks immediately upon seeing them.

We sell our equipment to only one plant in a town. Write for our proposition before some other concrete man starts manufacturing MacArthur blocks.

One Type of Wall
Here is one type of block made in our molds and laid in the wall. Our molds also manufacture block for silos, and the best silo you ever saw.

Send me without obligation, full details about MacArthur System of pouring concrete block, also address of nearest user.

McFELL INDUSTRIAL FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS

are noted for lowest maintenance and operation cost ever obtained.

McFell’s is a reliable fire alarm system with the highest possible percentage in operation efficiency.

The McFell system provides a circuit which will continue operative, as under normal conditions, while subject to troubles which would suspend service on other systems.

If a tree or a chimney fell upon the wires of the old type system, breaking them, or through some accident to a box on the circuit, if the circuit was open and the current ceased to flow, the protected feature would be entirely lost and the district covered by the said circuit would be without fire protection during such a period of time as the line was undergoing repairs. If this accident were to befall the McFell System no such condition would exist. Each box on the circuit would continue to turn in its proper alarm, as before, and the apparatus, gongs and other equipment functioning under normal conditions. It is at once apparent, therefore, that no question or doubt can exist as to the difference in efficiency between the old style loop circuit and the McFell metallic loop circuit, and while we are in a position to furnish the single loop circuit, to those who insist upon this character of apparatus we do not recommend it, and we would advise strongly against the use of the same.

Estimates gladly furnished for hotel, factory, warehouse, store or residence systems.

Write for our booklet entitled “Fire Alarm Apparatus” It will tell you more about McFell Fire Alarm Systems. Our system operates with wires short grounded or open
