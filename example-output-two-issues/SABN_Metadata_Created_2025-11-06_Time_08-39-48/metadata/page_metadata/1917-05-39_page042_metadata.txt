44 SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

commission, known as the "Public Buildings' Commission."

His high position with the American Institute of Architects has carried him to all principal American cities, where he has studied their problems.

Greensboro Builders Get Together.

Builders of Greensboro, N. C., including contractors for general construction work, architects and the specialists in various departments of building, had a meeting in late February. It was stated that the activity beginning or in prospect for the year in Greensboro and vicinity actuated the leaders who called the meeting to pursue the course.

Many well known firms have headquarters in Greensboro, and they have done large contracts in various parts of the country, and now expect to make every effort to get the lion's share of the construction work in the booming home town. It is anticipated that several million dollars will be turned loose in the next two years for huge improvements here, and the builders are seeking to put themselves in position to give the utmost service.

New Things in Houses.

When distinctive qualities embody character and promote comfort, an unusual residence fosters interest. That is the way with a small brick bungalow at Evanston, Ill., a house of swinging walls and disappearing rooms, that has amazed all who have examined it. It is a tiny, sun-flooded "doll's house" with light walls, white woodwork, and attractive, simple hangings.

Its outside dimensions, not including the protuberances, are about 27 by 25 feet. Yet it is a five-room house with living room, approximately 13 by 25 feet in size; two bedchambers, about 10½ by 14½ feet and 10 by 14½ feet, respectively; a dining room, 10 by 14½ feet, and a kitchen, 7½ by 10 feet, as well as a toilet room, small hall, one very roomy closet, and a kitchen entryway which accommodates a refrigerator.

Swinging walls are the secret of all this. The little house is really divided into a living room and kitchen. But only a trifle more time and energy are required in unfolding a fully furnished bedchamber, or a dining room, than attends the opening or closing of a door. The north walls of the living room—which are separated by a doorway opening into a small reception hall were hung on hinges and supported by heavy ball-bearing rollers. Firmly attached to the wall in the west half of the room, its legs reaching to within a half-inch of the floor, is a library table. On the other partition is a writing desk. Concealed behind the former wall are a dresser, chiffonier, and sewing machine. When this wall is swung back to form a bedroom, it fits the beamed opening extending from the hall doorway to the fireplace, and decreases the length of the living room to about 14 feet. A bed, to the foot of which a bench is attached, is then drawn out from the opposite wall. A doorway in one corner gives access to and from the other rooms.

The other—the east—end of the living room is converted into a dining room by a similar operation. When the wall in that half of the room is opened back and fastened in place beneath another beam, extending parallel with the first mentioned one, an attractive built-in china closet is disclosed, and a real dining room provided. Obviously, at such times the west end of the main room becomes the living room.

Radiator on New Lines.

A French concern has recently placed on the market a new type of radiator especially adapted to hot-water heating systems, which is much smaller than ordinary radiators and, in proportion to its size, gives off more heat. It is made of several coils, or sections, in the usual way. They are, however, wider from front to back than common coils, and so shaped that the sides of the radiator as a whole are marked by deep horizontal depressions. Extending diagonally from front to back are a series of partitions between the coils which serve to throw the warmed air out into the room instead of allowing it to rise straight up. The result of this arrangement is that the upper portion of the radiator is surrounded by air that is no warmer than that around the lower portion, and so its entire surface is put to use to heat the maximum amount of cool air. This form of construction, it is claimed, makes possible a saving of fuel.

House Built on Steep Slope.

A dwelling, which almost seems to hang on the side of a steep cliff, is an unusual architectural feature found not far from San Francisco. The west front of this peculiar house faces a street which is nearly 100 feet higher than the street on which the east front faces. For a dwelling of the ordinary type this almost perpendicular lot would be practically valueless, but in this case the architect has skillfully adapted the now popular Pueblo Indian style of architecture to the precipitous cliff and has produced a pleasing effect. The materials used are stucco and concrete. From the upper windows a magnificent panoramic view is obtained of the greater part of San Francisco, the bay, the cities across the bay, and the mountain range beyond. On the lower side retaining walls and shrubbery have been employed to good advantage to break the abrupt aspect of the slope. Steps mount to the entrance on this side, by easy inclines.
