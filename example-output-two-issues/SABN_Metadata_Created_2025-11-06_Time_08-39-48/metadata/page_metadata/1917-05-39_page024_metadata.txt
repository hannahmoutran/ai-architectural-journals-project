Barrett Specification Roofs

An Ideal Factory—
and an Ideal Roof

THE modern manufacturer floods his workrooms with sunshine, and his workmen keep in better health and do better work. Here is one of these factories. It is built in the most modern and scientific manner and is covered with a Barrett Specification Roof.

This is not to be wondered at. The wonder would be if some other type of roof had been specified, because most of the permanent structures of the country are covered with Barrett Specification Roofs.

This preference is due to the fact that such roofs cost less per year of service than any other kind; that they are free from all maintenance expenses and, further, because they are guaranteed for twenty years.

In addition, Barrett Specification Roofs take the base rate of fire insurance and are approved as “Class A” construction.

This combination of 20-Year Guaranty with low cost and low insurance rate has put these roofs in a class by themselves.
