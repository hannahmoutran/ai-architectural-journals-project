"Sanisep" Portable Sewerage Systems
Trade Mark Registered.

The Perfect System for suburban homes, schools, and developments, with or without running water.

"SANISEP" Tanks are made of reinforced concrete with solid bottom and are thoroughly waterproofed to prevent seepage. They require no cleaning out, no chemicals; are flyproof and odorless.

They employ the L. R. S. or two-tank principle of sewage disposal, which was devised and is recommended by the United States Public Health Service.

Many Architects and Contractors specify "SANISEP" Tanks, because they are recognized as being the solution of the sewage disposal problem for building beyond the reach of municipal sewer lines.

Write for catalogue and find out how economically "SANISEP" Tanks can be installed.
