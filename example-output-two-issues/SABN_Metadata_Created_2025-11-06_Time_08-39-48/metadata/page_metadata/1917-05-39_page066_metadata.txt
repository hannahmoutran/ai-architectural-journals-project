SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

Architects and Heating Contractors
It is better to estimate your radiation correct, than to wish you had.

Our B.T.U. Manual
For Estimating Steam and Water Radiation.
The tables have been most carefully compiled from the foremost standard authorities and are based on the actual transmission or loss of British Thermal Units through various agents and the B.T.U. emitted by radiation at various temperatures, pressures, etc. This places at your instant command information and data ordinarily available only to the best heating engineers and eliminates all guess work from your estimates. We will send manual and send to any reliable firm on ten days trial. If not as stated return to us and it will not cost you one cent.

CONCRETE ROADS
The Modern Permanent Highway

Built of Concrete. Andrews Avenue, Atlanta, Ga.
Dustless—Non-Slippery—Always Serviceable—Lowest Maintenance
The use of concrete for road and street construction is increasing rapidly throughout the country.
The experience of those communities which have built concrete highways has proven beyond question that concrete not only gives the most substantial construction, but also solves the perplexing question of maintenance because
Concrete Practically Eliminates Maintenance.
With sand and gravel or crushed rock available locally throughout the South and Portland Cement manufactured here at home, the cost of concrete roads is very low. Concrete roads are an INVESTMENT—not an EXPENSE.

DURABILITY
XXth Century Furnaces have been manufactured for 22 years. Wherever they have been installed they are still in use.

After all, it is the evidence of the user that is the final test.
Here is what Wm. S. Jessup, R.F.D., Friednwood, Indiana, has to say:
We have never bought a new grate or had the upkeep outside of dusting the pipes, but our old XXth Century Furnace, after 20 years, is as good as new. The floor of our cellar is damp, but the furnace is dry.
The XXth Century saves money in fuel and repairs and pleases the user.
“In the end a XXth Century is the cheapest and the best.”
Write for booklet “H” and a free heating plan.
