A list of references follows, naming various buildings and hospitals across multiple U.S. cities. The manufacturer's name, The Leon L. Wolf Paint Company, is prominently displayed at the bottom.

The lower right quarter is an ad for 'DEFIANCE SUPPLIES' with a bold, large uppercase title and a small illustration of a classical warrior figure holding a shield and sword, labeled 'DEFIANCE QUALITY.' The ad targets architects, engineers, and artists, promoting blue and black prints, lithographic reproductions, and compo-board. The company name, Defiance Mfg.
