SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

D & T
Leads the Way
to
Successful Hot Water Heating
Just as steam, electricity and the automobile are in advance of hand and horse power and old-style methods of travel, so the
D & T Tank-in-Basement System of Hot Water Heating
has superseded the old water-logged gravity and other methods of heating.

The D & T is not an untried or experimental system. Over 25,000 installations are now giving satisfactory service in all parts of the United States and Canada.

Indorsed by the leading architects, heating engineers, boiler manufacturers and jobbers.

You save money on the installation and your client saves one-fourth on his coal bills—only two of the many reasons why you should install the D & T Self-Regulating System.

Let us tell you more about it.
