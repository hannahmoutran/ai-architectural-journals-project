"Buy a Home" Propaganda.
The National "Buy a Home" campaign which has in recent months gained country-wide momentum, endorsed and recommended by the executive committee of the National Association of Real Estate Boards, seems to us to be launched along the right lines, because it appeals to the policy of home ownership which since the world began has been the dream of every man.
We are giving in this issue something of what this campaign is and how it is conducted, believing it will aid in the construction of better and more substantial homes and not the kind built merely for a quick, cheap sale as has unfortunately been the custom with some operators in the past.
Attend the Conventions.
Now approaches the time of the year when vacations are in order and with that in view, conventions of the builders, the architects and the allied interests are to be held at various points, for the most part at the seaside resorts or on the mountainside where members of the fraternity can mingle with each other and have a little recreation which they so much need. On account of international complications just at this time it might be well for these gatherings to assemble in the interior and turn the seaside resorts over to the troops as training quarters.
The Southern Architect and Building News wishes it were possible that everyone of our readers could arrange his business affairs so as to attend these meetings, for besides doing a duty in attending, the benefit to be gained from an interchange of ideas with other minds would amply repay anyone. By all means attend your state conventions, all of which have their educational features.
The War and Trade Paper Advertising.
In spite of war excitement this is the one time, above all others, when the trade paper advertiser should use more space.
It is a fact that Europe has about stopped placing munition contracts in this country.
Most of these contracts will be completed in a few months. European factories seem to be able to supply their home needs.
Our entry into the war, however, will give our munition factories plenty of work, but prices will not be like those exacted from the Allies. Uncle Sam will fix his own prices and the gun factories will operate on small profits.
While all this is going on our country is growing fabulously rich, and the demand for all kinds of building material, machinery and equipment in new plants will be greater than ever before.
He is the wise man who holds his factory to his regular line and keeps his old customers, and while the other fellow is making guns and shells and neglecting his regular home trade, this wise manufacturer is growing stronger with his regular customers and gaining new ones.
There was never such a chance to grow and ex-
