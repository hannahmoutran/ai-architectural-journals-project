SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS. 97

THE ALL-STEEL BODY OF
THE IMPERIAL
Warm Air Furnace
is rolled from a single steel plate and securely fastened by a single row of rivets. The top and bottom are also formed from single steel plates and riveted to the cylinder, forming a boiler without any opening or cast iron connections.

The All-Steel Body of IMPERIAL WARM AIR FURNACES has less riveted joints than any other steel warm air heater. Its heavy construction allows a greater heat to be generated without damaging the IMPERIAL WARM AIR FURNACE. Its All-Steel construction also causes it to radiate heat better than either cast or wrought iron warm air heaters.

Absolutely gas and dust tight.
No asbestos packing used.

A steel furnace is especially well adapted for moderate weather. As long as there is a hot coal of fire within the furnace, the Imperial continues to radiate the heat, while with a great many furnaces, especially a cast iron construction, it requires the burning of more fuel and more fire to get results.

Dealers all over the country are selling more All-Steel warm air heaters every day. The reason for this is that the superior All-Steel construction of warm air heaters is rapidly becoming known to the public. Our illustrated circular will convince you of the excellence of IMPERIAL ALL-STEEL WARM AIR FURNACES.
