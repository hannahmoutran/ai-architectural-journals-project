G. McNabb, Manager,\nCommonwealth Building,\nDallas, Texas.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have examined the electric floor indicator and supervising system which you recently had installed in the Commonwealth Building, and I am writing to express my appreciation of the efficient manner in which it is working. I wish to bring to your attention the fact that not only is your building one of the first to have installed the electric floor indicator and supervising system, but also that the installation is a complete success and has worked satisfactorily from the start. The operators are afforded a clear view of the position of their cars at all times, and the floor indicators furnish a means of communication between the manager's office and the operators.\n\nI believe you have an excellent equipment, and wish you the greatest success with same.\n\nYours very truly,\nC. H. Schmitt\n\nCLB-JBC\n\nThe fact that an elevator operator is the only one who knows the traffic condition in the shaft above the first floor, and of his particular condition of load, the responsibility of giving efficient service is dependent upon his cooperation with the passenger and manager.\n\nTo equip each car with a small cabinet in plain view of the operators, containing a row of electrically lighted indicators, each light representing a floor. The movement of any car will illuminate a number in each cabinet corresponding with the floor position of the car. This apprises the operator of the relative position of all the cars. Therefore, should a car get out of position, a distress signal provided can be set up in the pursuing car, signifying that due to unavoidable delays the signalling car must withdraw temporarily from service and depend on the signalled car to serve the floors passed up so that the proper running order may be adjusted.\n\nIlluminating the position of his own car renders unnecessary the display of numbers formerly used on the landing. Concealing the landing numbers from the view of the passengers compels them to announce their stops promptly, enabling the operator to save the loss of time and expense of over-running a landing.\n\nOur system provides the manager's office with means of communication and information as to the location of all cars in the building, and each car separately, therefore furnishing a complete check on the performance of each operator.\n\nThe installation consists of a simple wiring plan, without the use of coils or magnets, or any other mechanism that is likely to get out of order, neither does it require any adjustment or cost for maintenance.\n\nOur method of regulating elevator service has been approved by some of the best authorities on elevators and elevator service, and by all who have been interested in knowing the results obtained from its use.\n\nIllustrating a 3-car installation in an 8-story building, Car No. 1 first floor, Car No. 2 4th floor, Car No. 3 8th floor.\n\nFurnished by\nWAKEFIELD & McNABB,\nDALLAS, TEXAS\n\nFebruary 11th, 1916.\n\nMr. A.
