businesses, and will put the cards in prominent locations in their show windows, especially as they have no trouble or expense in getting them printed. Some of the larger stores will have their own sign painters use the phrase “Buy a Home” on every card they display in their show windows during “Buy a Home” week. Don’t use the name of the real estate board on any of these cards—keep the real estate end of the campaign in the background. The sign painter will charge about 20 cents each for getting out these cards.

5. Get the street car company to put “Buy a Home” cards for the week on the front end of each car. If an advertising company controls the privilege, possibly you can afford to pay them, as it is excellent advertising.

6. Have a quantity of yellow 6x6-inch cards with “Buy a Home” in red painted diagonally across on each side, and a hole punched in the upper corner. Insert strings and hang them on the radiator of every automobile you can induce to carry them during the week in question.

7. Get busy at once with your electric light, water and gas companies, and they will print “Buy a Home” in red ink on their May bills. Take this up at once.

8. At a cost of 15 or 20 cents each, you can have “Buy a Home” rubber stamps made for each real estate firm, and let them stamp each of their May bills with it. It can also be used effectively on letter heads and envelopes.

9. Get all of your newspapers, daily and weekly, to write “Buy a Home” editorials, and get the reporters to show their ingenuity by writing attractive stories of the campaign.

10. Get all the real estate men to do extra newspaper advertising that week, all of them featuring “Buy a Home” bargains and urging the advantages of home ownership. The newspapers will gladly run “Buy a Home” streamers across the top of the real estate page. The advertising solicitors can be of great assistance in getting up attractive displays.

11. It would be very appropriate for the women’s clubs to talk “Buy a Home” during that week, especially as the women are nearly always the inspiration of home ownership.

12. By all means get every real estate broker and salesman enthusiastic on “Buy a Home.” One of the best effects of this or any other advertising campaign is on the advertiser himself, and every salesman should have carefully planned just what he intends to accomplish during “Buy a Home” week. If the individual doesn’t put any thought or effort into the campaign, he isn’t going to get anything out of it. On the other hand, if he does put into it enthusiasm and intelligent study, we’ll guarantee good results.

Augusta to Have Builders’ Exchange.

A hundred and fifty men representing every line of building activity in the city of Augusta, Ga., met in an enthusiastic meeting recently for the purpose of forming the Augusta Builders’ Exchange.

Mr. Joe T. Lawrence of the McKenzie Building Company presided over the meeting.

Mr. T. T. Flagler of Atlanta, the state commissioner of the National Association of Builders’ Exchanges, made a most interesting talk on the work accomplished by the national association and told of its rapid growth in recent years. This association now numbers over 9,000 members in the United States. In his talk Mr. Flagler emphasized the fact that co-operation was absolutely necessary in the interests of the allied building trades were to be conserved.

Following Mr. Flagler, Mr. Dan Carey, the secretary of the Atlanta Builders’ Association addressed the meeting and in a very pleasing way outlined the work of the Atlanta association. There were none present who were not convinced by his talk that Augusta stood badly in need of such an organization and a great deal of enthusiasm was aroused among the men present. At this point slips of application for membership were passed around largely signed by men who will be charter members of the new association. The membership in the association is open to all firms and individuals who are in any way connected with building.

Mr. F. E. Gibson of the Woodward Lumber Company spoke of the necessity of organization if the building trades of Augusta were to protect themselves. He endorsed the plan heartily and pledged the full support of his company. Short talks were also made by Mr. McNeil of the Whitney-McNeil Electric Company, Mr. E. J. Erbelding, and Mr. Brill of the Brill Electric Company.

The meeting was then adjourned to meet at a later date to organize and take up the question of the election of a secretary for the new organization.

Architects Coming to Atlanta.

Upon the invitation from the Georgia chapter, the Convention bureau and others, the executive committee of the American Institute of Architects selected Atlanta as the next meeting place of their committee. After entertaining President John Lawrence Mauran at the convention of the Builders’ exchanges in February, Atlanta had no difficulty in securing the meeting. President Mauran has written Mayor Candler that the committee “is looking forward to the enjoyment of Atlanta’s matchless climate and hospitality.” The meeting will probably be held this month, and will attract about two hundred architects from the southeastern states.
