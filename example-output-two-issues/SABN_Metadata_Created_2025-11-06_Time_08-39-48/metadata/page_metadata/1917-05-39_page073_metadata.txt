Kewanee “All-Steel” Coal Chutes

Interior view of the Kewanee chute, showing the inner flanges which hold it in the wall. These flanges can be taken off until the chute is placed and then bolted on. There are also two lag screws which are put up through the top making a good solid job of installation.

Note the method of locking and the apron which extends out over the foundation throwing the coal out into the bin where it belongs, without injuring the wall.

Cross section view of the Kewanee “ALL STEEL” coal chute, showing the construction and the method of operation.
Our regular stock sizes are for an eight inch wall, but make them for any thickness of wall by just merely lengthening the flanges. The Kewanee “ALL STEEL” chute is the easiest chute on the market to install. They are guaranteed for five years but will last a lifetime.
When you install a “Kewanee” you never have to go back and do repairing.
Special proposition to Dealers and Contractors.
