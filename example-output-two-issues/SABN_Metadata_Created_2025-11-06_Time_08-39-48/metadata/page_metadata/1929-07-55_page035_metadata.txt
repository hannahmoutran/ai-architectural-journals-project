Southern Architectural and Industrial Arts Exposition

Announcement of Medals to be Awarded

ARCHITECTURE is an assembly of all the arts. By a joint exhibit of drawings and photographs of buildings executed, also of the products of the arts and crafts and building materials, all of which enter into the completed work, the public will better visualize the successful consummation of the architect’s conception. In this exhibit the industrial arts in their various forms, decoration, furniture, textiles, sculpture and paintings should play an important part.

There is no more potent method of placing before the public the importance of the architect’s function, than by showing the extent of the field drawn on by him to produce the building which we admire in its completed state. Architecture is truly “the mother of the arts” and this exposition will demonstrate that truth.

The arrangement of the exhibit has, as its focal point, the drawings and photographs of executed work; and around this will be grouped the exhibits of the manufacturers whose products have made our buildings successful. The Court of Honor forms the crossing of the two avenues of architectural exhibits. In this space, open to the exhibits of architects only, it is hoped each member of the profession will be fully represented by reproductions of his best work. Perspectives, models, studies of detail either in the form of sketches or photographs, in fact as varied a selection of documents as we can collect should be assembled in this exhibit. Enlargements of photographs are a splendid medium for presentation. Details of the requirements for exhibits will be distributed later.

We are producing, in the South, some of the most worthwhile architectural work of the country, and now is the time to let the public know it. There is no more convincing method of showing this than by placing reproductions of our work on view, and we believe that this exposition is the ideal method of proving what we know to be a fact. A great many of us have been so busy producing that we have overlooked the duty that we owe to ourselves of showing our work to the public in such a way that they will realize the authorship of the work.

Around the architectural exhibits will be grouped the exhibits of industrial art, all exhibits arranged in architectural setting. Surrounding these will be the exhibits of building materials and mechanical appliances used to make the buildings beautiful and useful. The manufacturer of building products is daily becoming more aware of the value of art. The cry of the degradation of art by the machine is being discounted more and more as beautiful product follows beautiful product on the market. To the architect this will be one of the most instructive and enjoyable parts of the exhibit.

The whole scheme of arrangement of the exhibition is planned to stress the importance of architecture and show to the public what effort the architect expends in behalf of his client.

As an evidence of the interest in this exposition a number of medals have been offered. The method of award and the juries who will make these awards will be announced in circulars of information which will be sent to all Southern Chapters of the American Institute of Architects and to all architects practicing in the South as far as it is possible to reach them. The following medals have been announced to date. Mr. Walk C. Jones of Jones and Furbringer of Memphis, offers a gold medal for the best individual exhibit. Mr. Tebbs of Tebbs & Knell of New York, offers a medal in memory of Mr. Neel Reid of the former architectural firm of Hentz, Reid & Adler of Atlanta for the best exhibit of domestic architecture costing under $20,000.00. Mr. Henry E. Harman, Jr., offers a gold medal in memory of his father Henry E. Harman founder of the “Southern Architect and Building News” for the best domestic architecture costing over $20,000.00. The Southern Architect and Building News offers a gold medal for the best public work and another gold medal for the best mercantile work. Mr. Milton S. Biswanger of Biswanger & Company, glass manufacturers of Memphis, offers a medal for the best ecclesiastical work.

It is planned to make this exposition one of the outstanding cultural events in the South. The President of the American Institute of Architects has promised to be present at the opening which will be formal and by invitation only.

The success of this exhibit depends on the efforts of all. It cannot be put over by a few. Let each individual member of the profession do all in his power to make his the outstanding exhibit and we will show the world what we know in our hearts to be true that the work of Southern Architects is the “ne plus ultra” of architectural achievement.
