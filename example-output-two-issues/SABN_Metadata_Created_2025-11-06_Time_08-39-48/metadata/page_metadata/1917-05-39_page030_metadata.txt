32 SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

Kenyon Cox that follows closely an academic formula, and therefore must be valueless as a document, and one by Ellen Emmet, in which the literal facts concerning form, features, construction are made to seem, perhaps, over important as though the detail of a mole on a man's face was to be turned into a conclusive argument in the judgment of his character.

Hering points to the puny in minor details with big comprehensive truths. One finds them in his portrait of Bishop Talbot, of Southern Pennsylvania, and in his portrait of Roger Platt, the son of Charles Platt, the architect. In this latter portrait one sees not only the boy Roger, but an epic to the spirit of American youth. It is handled in much the same way that Praxiteles handled that head of Hermes, the smooth clearness of the face accentuated by the tumbled roughness of the hair.

Indeed the spirit of the ancient Greeks is to be found often as not in the works of Mr. Hering. It is decidedly apparent, for example, in a little statuette of Venus, hands uphold a drapery that hangs in symmetrical folds, the proportions lending grace, the attitude, dignity, the almost frenzied coldness of the manipulation of flesh—the godlike purity of the Greeks, clear as air on a fine winter day.

It is the bronze Diana that Mr. Hering considers his masterpiece and in which he has made of reserve a fine art. That statuette shows a Diana new to modernity, a Diana that is really a goddess, free from earthly temptation, from material care, happy, joyous, but refined and as divine as though she were a goddess of Hering's own religion. He shows her in lines that are clear and continuous, sinuous and unhampered, devoid of prudery. Continuous line, but not too continuous, too suave, which, like urbanity, is vulgar.

Another picture of joy, less dignified, more youthful than the joy of Diana, that is ageless, is his figure, suggested by Milton's 'L'Allegro,' blowing through pipes similar to those of Pan and dancing, her face lighted, like her figure, by the joy of rhythmic tune and motion.

A catalogue of Hering's work would be entirely inadequate if it did not include examples of his work in bas-relief. Here one may not forget that he was a pupil of Saint Gaudens who knew how to lend air and even color to a flat surface. His bas-reliefs reach a little fulled into the province of the painted picture. Their forms are a little fuller, a little more robust than those of Saint Gaudens. I am thinking of the bas-relief of Everts Tracy, the architect; of Charles Albert Coffin, the president of the General Electric, and of the group portrait of Alice Olin Dows and of Stephen Olin Dows. The last is captivatingly decorative. This may be said too of his medal for the Scarsdale Golf and Country Club, an arrangement of Scotch thistle, which it is possible he may win himself, as much of his spare time is devoted to golf.

Elsewhere in that catalogue designs for architectural motifs should be given a prominent place. In this field of his work the most apt examples are to be found in a lioness wearing the Egyptian headdress, seated, the lines of her figure rigid, her gaze impenetrable—a sphinx truly; in the terminals of the seasons now at the Harkness house of which Gamble Rogers was the architect; in the fountain of the boy and the dolphin in the Mather house, Cleveland, which Charles Platt designed, and in a beautifully arranged figure of Pan, the immortal, for the fountain of the Dows house at Rhinebeck, designed by Albro and Lindeberg—here is a strong feeling by the sculptor that his art is indeed allied to architecture.

Builders of Raleigh Organized.

The Raleigh Building Trades Association is a new venture launched at Raleigh, N. C., and one in which is represented over three hundred men in the building industry of Raleigh and vicinity. The following officers were elected: John Thiem, president; J. C. Murphy, vice president; W. T. Barrow, business agent.

The purpose of this organization is as in all trades organizations, for the benefit of the men engaged in the building trade. According to reports, there is a bright outlook for the new organization.
