KING TANK HEATERS are ideal for hot water supply
On only one bucket of coal a day, the King Tank Heater heats all the water needed by a large or small family. The strong, compact construction gives it years of life. The low first cost becomes almost negligible when prorated on a yearly basis. It requires a minimum of attention. It can be used anywhere in city, town or country—in hot, mild, or cold weather. The heat of the stove is unnoticeable in the basement or kitchen—it all goes into the water. That’s the secret of King economy. You should have full information on this Tank Heater. Write for it today.
