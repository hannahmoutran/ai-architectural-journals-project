SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

The Sleeping One.
Richard Engelmann, Sculptor.

in 1905, a change in his style was brought about. Engelmann had come in touch with the Secession and gradually the essential ideas of this group gained control over his thoughts. After exceedingly serious study he produced, in 1906, “The Woman with the Gloves.” The face and hair are modeled with the simplest surfaces; the lines meet in severe angles and the broad sleeves which offered opportunity for a tumult of folds and carvings, are unmoved save for a few incisions at the joints modified by the horizontal position of the lower arm.

Previous to this, a sketch for “A Resting Woman” had been created. Engelmann happened to see a very sick woman with relaxed limbs just before her death, and he was so strongly impressed that he made his sketch, which an architect friend asked him to reproduce in stone for the garden of his mother in Osnabrueck. The three factors of the study, “The Woman with the Gloves,” the object of the dying woman and the commission of the architect, combined to form the turning point in Engelmann’s career; and in “The Resting Woman” Engelmann’s true self is revealed; from this time on his ways point toward mature works of beauty and greatness.

Want Assistant Inspector of Engineering Material.

The United States Civil Service Commission announces an open competitive examination for assistant inspector of engineering material (aircraft), for men only. Vacancies occurring in the Office of Inspector of Engineering Material at Boston, Mass., Brooklyn, N. Y., and Pittsburgh, Pa., at $4.48 to $5.04 per diem, and in positions requiring similar qualifications at any navy yard or other naval establishment of the United States will be filled from this examination, unless it is found in the interest of the service to fill any vacancy by reinstatement, transfer, or promotion.

There are at present six vacancies, namely, one at Boston, two at Brooklyn, and three at Buffalo, N. Y., in the Pittsburgh district.

In filling vacancies certification will be made of the highest eligibles residing in the vicinity of the place at which the appointee is to be employed, except that upon the request of th department certification will be made of the highest eligibles on the register for the entire country who have expressed willingness to accept appointment where the vacancy exists.

The duties of this position will consist in requiring contractors to carry out plans and specifications prepared by the Navy Department for machinery and material used in connection with air planes for the United States Navy and passing upon tests of such machinery and material.

Competitors will not be required to report for examination at any place, but will be rated on the following subjects, which will have the relative weights indicated, on a scale of 100: (1) General and technical education, 40; (2) experience, 60.

Applicants must be capable of preparing reports and of interpreting plans as presented in blue prints and specifications. They should have a thorough knowledge of the assembly and operation of gas engines in general and particularly of those types of engines used in air planes. They should possess particular knowledge of air craft and of the character of material which enters into air-craft construction, and should be familiar with the methods and processes used by manufacturers in air-craft construction.

One year’s experience as a machinist in a factory constructing gas engines for automobiles or air planes, or as an inspector of air-plane or automobile engines or one year’s actual experience in flying is a prerequisite for consideration for this position.
