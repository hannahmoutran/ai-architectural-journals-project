SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

Write Us a Letter.
We want our readers to feel that The Southern Architect and Building News is their paper, and that what interests them interests its publishers and subscribers. We will therefore appreciate most highly any communications, experiences or suggestions, or marked copies of local papers containing items of news pertaining to the interests of the fraternity.

Architect Opens Additional Office.
J. F. Leitner, architect, who has been established at Wilmington, N. C., for 11 years, has opened an additional office in Atlanta, Ga., with headquarters in the Healey Bldg. From the Atlanta office Mr. Leitner will take care of business originating in the extreme Southeastern States, while business from the middle South will be handled at his Wilmington office.

New Partnership Formed.
William T. Warren and Eugene H. Knight, both well-known architects have formed a partnership for the practice of architecture, with offices in the Empire Building, Birmingham, Ala.

Architect Ware Dead.
William Roth Ware, an architect, and for many years editor of the American Architect and Building News, died March 28. He was 68 years old and was widely known as a writer on architectural subjects.

Mr. E. J. Putnam—An Appreciation.
On March 7, Rock Products and Building Materials printed this tribute to our fellow townsman, Mr. E. J. Putnam, which we are pleased to reproduce because of his wide popularity in this territory:
Edward Jeness Putnam, the new GF waterproofing manager for the Southern GF Co., of Atlanta, Ga., was born in Cleveland, Ohio, some time prior to the Spanish-American war. As a boy he started working in an architect’s office and intended making architecture his life work. However, he soon found himself in an engineering school in Cleveland studying civil engineering. This did not last long, for the call of architecture was too strong to resist, and he entered the building game, where he has been ever since. He has handled various lines and occupied various positions—from “Knight of the Road” to the “sales manager’s throne.” He has been manager of the supply department of large building organizations. For the past ten years he has been promoting and performing missionary work throughout the South for various lines of building products. He has put several new products on the map in virgin territory, which is only small evidence of “Put’s” ability. By his genial manner, vast knowledge of Southern building conditions and his spirit of helpfulness, he has made a wide and valued acquaintance among architects, engineers and contractors. “Put” has many nick-names. Throughout the South he made “Kore-Lock” famous and next to “Put” he is most widely known as “Kore-Lock” Putnam—the man with the iron jaw.” For the past four years he has been connected with Trus-Con Laboratories as district director. At present, as stated in the beginning, he is with the Southern GF Co., of Atlanta, Ga., as manager of the GF waterproofing department for nine big southern states. Mr. Putnam will have complete charge of GF waterproofing in Southern territory. He is exceptionally well fitted for this particular work. The General Fireproofing Co. already has an enviable reputation for quality in this line and the addition of Mr. Putnam will assist materially in placing GF waterproofings, concrete hardeners and wall coatings in this territory. His thorough knowledge of waterproofing conditions, together with his reputation as an eminent authority in his line give him good welcome among all architects and engineers throughout the South.

Edw. Jeness Putnam,
Waterproofing Manager, Southern GF Co., Atlanta, Ga.
