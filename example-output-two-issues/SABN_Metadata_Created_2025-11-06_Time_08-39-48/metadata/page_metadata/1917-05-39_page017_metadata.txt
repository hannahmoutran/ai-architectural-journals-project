Design No. B-500
INTERNAL CAST BRONZE MEMORIALS—The above cast bronze was designed and cast by us for Mr. John W. Gates, of New York, who placed it in the hospital at Port Arthur, Texas. Size 42x30 inches and was finished by hand. A number of these bronze designs are in stock. We can execute bronze tablets on new die drawings, depending on the character of work in finishing, art work in the design, and amount of lettering.

"Trouble-Saver Scaffolds"

Pay for themselves from the money saved on the first two jobs.

Did you ever figure up the money you lose in building old wooden scaffolding; the nails and lumber wasted, and your men’s time lost (a half day in most cases)?

Compare this expensive method with the slinging of the "Trouble-Saver" Scaffolds. No nails to drive—no bothering with bolts or screws. The "Trouble-Saver" is simply hooked around a studding. Ten minutes’ work.

And the "Trouble-Saver" won’t break; can’t slip; stays absolutely rigid until taken down.

We are offering a 30-day Free Trial to carpenters just to prove that these Scaffolds are really an investment.

Write for our proposition and see how much you can save
