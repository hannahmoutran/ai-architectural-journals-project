SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS

pand—never such a chance to keep old customers and get new ones—never such a chance to advertise to the best advantage as now.

The war will soon be over. It will soon spend itself. Then will naturally come the great spurt of prosperity which follows every war. The United States will be rich and there will open an era of building activity never seen in the world. Vast fortunes will seek investment. The wise man who has stuck to his safe line of manufacture will not only have his old trade, but new trade as well. The day of his good fortune will then dawn. He will reap the reward of patience and consistency.

The munition maker will have to readjust his business. His new occupation will be gone. He will have to go back to his old line of manufacture.

But here he will meet unexpected difficulties. The trade which he abandoned three years ago will have been taken over by his competitors who did not go into the war game. That competitor kept at his old line, kept advertising to his customers, and when the gun maker comes back to hunt up his old trade he will find it gone forever. The other man has it and will keep it.

Therefore, there never was such an opportunity to use the trade paper for exploiting one's products as at present. While the other fellow is dallying with the war game, double your trade paper space. For the time being the other fellow is asleep and now is your chance to capture his customers. When once you get them they will remain yours.

In a publishing experience of twenty-five years, I have never known a time when trade paper advertising was so important, so practical and so certain of fixed results as the present. For when the war ends the advertising done now will have a double value, first in producing new customers while your competitor is "off duty," and also in the increased demand for your goods which is sure to follow the declaration of peace.

Advertise now, as you never did before, and reap results of an hundred fold. There can be no question about this investment, for the returns are absolutely certain.

Now for Thrift and Economy.

As this is being written in early April it seems almost certain that before these lines get in cold type that there will have been declared by the Congress of the United States that a state of war exists between this country and the German nation which calls for every industry in this land from now on to pursue a policy of thrift and economy in the conduct of affairs, and we believe it to be the duty of every industrial magazine to call upon its readers for a united stand upon these principles.

There never was a time in the history of this country when thrift was so much needed as now, as well as economy. The poorer classes of people are, in the high cost of food products, paying more than their share of the obligations imposed upon us by the war abroad and thriftlessness at home. The pathetic aspect of the situation lies in the fact that those who are least responsible suffer most. Today the admission is generally made that extravagant living is one of the besetting sins of American life. The average American home wastes excessively. Statisticians tell us that we waste eight billion dollars yearly in this country. Experts in such matters have figured out that 10 per cent of our food stuffs is wasted by the housekeepers in this country.

During this impending war with Germany, if war should come, as President Wilson so admirably put it in his wonderful message to Congress; "It will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible." This means the conservation of all our cotton products, of our sources of structural materials of all sorts, of our mining operations, and in fact no unnecessary waste whatever.

Thrift of time is just as essential as thrift in money, and saving the seconds is just as valuable as saving pennies. It would be a good idea if people everywhere would form the habit of keeping a strict account of what they do every minute of every day. They would soon be amazed at the amount of time they waste. It would be a good idea, merely as an enlightening experiment, if for no other reason, if everyone of our readers would provide himself with a time account book and keep a record of every minute with the same accuracy that many persons keep a record of each cent spent.

Even if by some now unforeseen miracle this country should not enter war with the German autocracy, not the German people, then this preachment will not be amiss and the industries of the nation will be all the better off to put it into practice year in and year out in time of peace as well as in time of war, if it must come.

Engineers Offer for War.

The Florida Engineering Society, which has a membership of more than 150 engineers, wired Governor Catts of Florida offering immediately through him to the federal government the services of its members should they be needed for war.
