SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS
Pullmanize Your Windows
ASK FOR PLAN of an arrangement we have evolved for windows which has met with wide approval among architects. It effects a considerable saving in construction, cuts down mullions to the minimum and in every way has given unqualified satisfaction.
All Pullman Steel Unit Sash Balances used in this connection are fast supplanting cords and weights. They require only a small mortise, and as they have a uniform size face plate the mortise can be cut at the mill when the frames are made. All parts are in the easing—nothing can rub or interfere with the spring action. There is nothing to squeak, rattle, bang or stick. Once installed and it will never require contractors’, builders’ or architects’ attention. There is in every Pullman Sash Balance satisfaction for owner and builder alike. Guaranteed for 10 years. Over five million in use.
'Way back in June, 1890, over twenty-five years ago, the General Hospital (Surgical Building), Rochester, N. Y., installed Pullman Unit Sash Balances. They report that these Balances are in fine working order today. Their noiseless operation appealed to them.
In the Wilsonia, a fine modern apartment in Rochester, Pullman Unit Sash Balances are used for all the windows. The windows are large and the service severe. The owner says: “They move as noiselessly and easily as though supported by an air cushion.” He also reports a saving of about $1.00 per window through their use.
Approved by Board of Fire Underwriters for Fire Proof Buildings.

Hot Water Heating From the Fireplace
Everyone enjoys the cheerful open grate fire with its healthful ventilation; but owing to the great loss of heat up the flue in the old style fire-place, few can afford to operate them with the constant advance in the price of fuel.
We are pleased to make announcement to the Home-builder, Architect and Contractor of a Fire-place Heater constructed with a Water-coil made of 30 lineal feet 1” charcoal iron pipe (not steel) being very durable. The coil is connected by pipes to ordinary Hot Water Radiators placed in any distant rooms; in this way the various rooms are heated with heat lost up the flue in the old style fireplace.
This Hot Water Fire-place Heater costs little more than an ordinary grate outside of the cost of the radiators, piping, etc., necessary, but this can almost be saved in fuel in one winter.
It will heat a medium size residence in a moderate climate.
As an auxiliary to a cellar hot water boiler it is invaluable in any climate.
