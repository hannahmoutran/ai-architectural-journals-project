The Architect and the Community

EVERY right-minded person feels a sense of pride in a beautiful, imposing structure which adds a harmonious note to its environment and causes the stranger within our gates to pause, stand still and admire.

The influence of such a structure, be it large or small, mansion or cottage, is deeper and more enduring than that of printed description or of glowing advertisement because it is more deliberately received, and itself is its own interpreter.

In the development of civic pride such an asset is no mere accident. It is the expression of both the artistic and the mechanical instinct and has a cultural value. Whether the structure adorns in stately fashion some corner on a busy, business thoroughfare, or whether as private home or municipal grouping, crowns in classic style some knoll of Nature’s handiwork hard by some scenic boulevard or lake front, or whether it graces rustic surroundings in some outlying suburb, if it is attractive in design, consistent with the purpose for which it was built, and durable in character, such a group bears an uplifting message to every beholder.

About the first thing to which the attention of tourists is invited, upon their visit to any of the great cities of this continent or of the ancient capitals of Europe, is some historic building or grouping or architectural triumph which distinguishes that particular community.

But along before such a structure began to take visible form it existed first as an invisible idea, in the imagination of some master mind, although the multitude of details necessary to produce the finished product of that mind-image may never have been contemplated nor comprehended in the original source of the idea.

Some one had to be able to estimate and assemble all the elements entering into the structure, each in its proper place and proportion. In this process it first took visible form in pencil sketches, skillfully drawn designs, accurately scaled and scientifically, as well as artistically proportioned. Here art and science were requisitioned to bring into completeness the structure desired to fulfill a great civic, inspired human purpose.

Not an accident nor scintilla of chance in the whole scheme, but the demonstration of scientific skill belonging to but one profession, and of that profession one sees but little in public print. Like that of law and medicine, the architect’s profession is on a non-competitive basis, has its abode in the intellect, requiring years of education and special preparation along established standards, and consequently is never advertised in the commonly accepted sense of the term.

But the value of the architect is known and realized by every person who is wise in building operations. His advice is valuable concerning the property upon which you intend to build; in choosing the right spot for the structure, and even the real estate itself, which, under the improvement contemplated, is expected to yield profitable returns, is in many instances chosen solely upon the advice of an architect.

He understands how to translate the sun’s rays into cash value. Certain conditions of your structure demand sunlight and ventilation. Upon scientifically considering the relationship of its proportions to sun exposure and average wind pressure, keeping constantly in view the artistic effects of the structure, the architect designs to a minuteness just the proper court areas.

Prevents Expensive Blunders.

Times without number he has discovered at a glance that a certain lot, upon which it was the intention of the owner to build for rental purposes, was far less advantageously situated for such purposes than the owner had thought on account of having an alley, which conditions required larger interior courts and cut down the usable area of ground.

And this in the nick of time when the contractor-builder, in this respect an untrained man, was going right ahead on plans he had himself furnished free of charge as part of the deal, thereby saving the owner of the lot a few dollars for the time being, but at the cost of perpetual disappointment and infinitely heavier loss on the whole investment.

Plans of untrained men never develop into effect-
