Electric Daylight
for your job will make your night gang a day gang.

For the short winter days, nightwork and overtime, these lamps produce daylight after the sun has set.

They can be used in or out of doors—no moving parts—no arc lamp trimming.

Light can be projected over large areas or projected in solid beam.

First Aid to Sick Heating Systems

"It is never too late to mend" water-logged, air-bound or noisy steam heating systems, with the

Lytton Thermo Syphon Trap

Just try it on the most hopeless old steam heating installation you know of and watch results. It is entirely automatic in operation. Connect it up to any one-pipe or two-pipe system and the Lytton Trap will do the rest.

Here is what the Lytton Trap Does:

Collects and automatically discharges direct into boiler all condensation as fast as it forms, irrespective of the pressure or vacuum.
Releases all air and non-condensable gases without loss of vapor.
Discharges returns from below water line into the boiler.
Eliminates pumps, receivers, air relief tanks and boiler pits.
Prevents "hammering," flooded or air-bound radiators and burning of boilers.
Assures perfect circulation and even distribution of heat.

Install the Lytton Trap on your new work as well as old. It will help you to win the confidence and selling influence of your trade. Write for Bulletin No. 14 and for our Special Agency Proposition. There is still some desirable territory open.
