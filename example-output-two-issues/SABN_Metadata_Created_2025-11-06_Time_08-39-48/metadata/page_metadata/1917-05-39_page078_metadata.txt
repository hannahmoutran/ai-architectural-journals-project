VITROLITE
"Better Than Marble"

Kitchens Make Clean Inviting Rooms

A kitchen in which Vitrolite is installed will be a joy forever to the mistress of the home because dirt or dust can instantly be detected on its beautiful, smooth, white surface and be removed quickly and easily with soap and water. A vitrolite kitchen will always look clean, wholesome and sanitary.

Vitrolite has a rich, deep color like statuary marble; is very hard—non-porous and acid proof. It cannot be stained nor will it discolor. It has a wonderful surface that is as enduring as stone and looks like that on the finest Dresden China.

Let us tell you more about our material and its uses.
