On account of international complications just at this time it might be well for these gatherings to assemble in the interior and turn the seaside resorts over to the troops as training quarters.\nThe Southern Architect and Building News wishes it were possible that everyone of our readers could arrange his business affairs so as to attend these meetings, for besides doing a duty in attending, the benefit to be gained from an interchange of ideas with other minds would amply repay anyone. By all means attend your state conventions, all of which have their educational features.\nThe War and Trade Paper Advertising.\nIn spite of war excitement this is the one time, above all others, when the trade paper advertiser should use more space.\nIt is a fact that Europe has about stopped placing munition contracts in this country.\nMost of these contracts will be completed in a few months. European factories seem to be able to supply their home needs.\nOur entry into the war, however, will give our munition factories plenty of work, but prices will not be like those exacted from the Allies. Uncle Sam will fix his own prices and the gun factories will operate on small profits.\nWhile all this is going on our country is growing fabulously rich, and the demand for all kinds of building material, machinery and equipment in new plants will be greater than ever before.\nHe is the wise man who holds his factory to his regular line and keeps his old customers, and while the other fellow is making guns and shells and neglecting his regular home trade, this wise manufacturer is growing stronger with his regular customers and gaining new ones.\nThere was never such a chance to grow and ex-\n133770",

    "textTranscription": "SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS\n\npand—never such a chance to keep old customers and get new ones—never such a chance to advertise to the best advantage as now.\n\nThe war will soon be over. It will soon spend itself. Then will naturally come the great spurt of prosperity which follows every war. The United States will be rich and there will open an era of building activity never seen in the world. Vast fortunes will seek investment. The wise man who has stuck to his safe line of manufacture will not only have his old trade, but new trade as well. The day of his good fortune will then dawn. He will reap the reward of patience and consistency.\n\nThe munition maker will have to readjust his business. His new occupation will be gone. He will have to go back to his old line of manufacture.\n\nBut here he will meet unexpected difficulties. The trade which he abandoned three years ago will have been taken over by his competitors who did not go into the war game. That competitor kept at his old line, kept advertising to his customers, and when the gun maker comes back to hunt up his old trade he will find it gone forever. The other man has it and will keep it.\n\nTherefore, there never was such an opportunity to use the trade paper for exploiting one's products as at present. While the other fellow is dallying with the war game, double your trade paper space. For the time being the other fellow is asleep and now is your chance to capture his customers. When once you get them they will remain yours.\n\nIn a publishing experience of twenty-five years, I have never known a time when trade paper advertising was so important, so practical and so certain of fixed results as the present. For when the war ends the advertising done now will have a double value, first in producing new customers while your competitor is \"off duty,\" and also in the increased demand for your goods which is sure to follow the declaration of peace.\n\nAdvertise now, as you never did before, and reap results of an hundred fold. There can be no question about this investment, for the returns are absolutely certain.\n\nNow for Thrift and Economy.\n\nAs this is being written in early April it seems almost certain that before these lines get in cold type that there will have been declared by the Congress of the United States that a state of war exists between this country and the German nation which calls for every industry in this land from now on to pursue a policy of thrift and economy in the conduct of affairs, and we believe it to be the duty of every industrial magazine to call upon its readers for a united stand upon these principles.\n\nThere never was a time in the history of this country when thrift was so much needed as now, as well as economy. The poorer classes of people are, in the high cost of food products, paying more than their share of the obligations imposed upon us by the war abroad and thriftlessness at home. The pathetic aspect of the situation lies in the fact that those who are least responsible suffer most. Today the admission is generally made that extravagant living is one of the besetting sins of American life. The average American home wastes excessively. Statisticians tell us that we waste eight billion dollars yearly in this country. Experts in such matters have figured out that 10 per cent of our food stuffs is wasted by the housekeepers in this country.\n\nDuring this impending war with Germany, if war should come, as President Wilson so admirably put it in his wonderful message to Congress; \"It will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible.\" This means the conservation of all our cotton products, of our sources of structural materials of all sorts, of our mining operations, and in fact no unnecessary waste whatever.\n\nThrift of time is just as essential as thrift in money, and saving the seconds is just as valuable as saving pennies. It would be a good idea if people everywhere would form the habit of keeping a strict account of what they do every minute of every day. They would soon be amazed at the amount of time they waste. It would be a good idea, merely as an enlightening experiment, if for no other reason, if everyone of our readers would provide himself with a time account book and keep a record of every minute with the same accuracy that many persons keep a record of each cent spent.\n\nEven if by some now unforeseen miracle this country should not enter war with the German autocracy, not the German people, then this preachment will not be amiss and the industries of the nation will be all the better off to put it into practice year in and year out in time of peace as well as in time of war, if it must come.\n\nEngineers Offer for War.\n\nThe Florida Engineering Society, which has a membership of more than 150 engineers, wired Governor Catts of Florida offering immediately through him to the federal government the services of its members should they be needed for war.",

It effects a considerable saving in construction, cuts down mullions to the minimum and in every way has given unqualified satisfaction.\nAll Pullman Steel Unit Sash Balances used in this connection are fast supplanting cords and weights. They require only a small mortise, and as they have a uniform size face plate the mortise can be cut at the mill when the frames are made. All parts are in the easing—nothing can rub or interfere with the spring action. There is nothing to squeak, rattle, bang or stick. Once installed and it will never require contractors’, builders’ or architects’ attention. There is in every Pullman Sash Balance satisfaction for owner and builder alike. Guaranteed for 10 years. Over five million in use.\n'Way back in June, 1890, over twenty-five years ago, the General Hospital (Surgical Building), Rochester, N. Y., installed Pullman Unit Sash Balances. They report that these Balances are in fine working order today. Their noiseless operation appealed to them.\nIn the Wilsonia, a fine modern apartment in Rochester, Pullman Unit Sash Balances are used for all the windows. The windows are large and the service severe. The owner says: “They move as noiselessly and easily as though supported by an air cushion.” He also reports a saving of about $1.00 per window through their use.\nApproved by Board of Fire Underwriters for Fire Proof Buildings.\nSend TODAY for our Complete Catalog\nPullman Mfg. Company, 8 Industrial Street Rochester, N.Y.\nHot Water Heating From the Fireplace\nEveryone enjoys the cheerful open grate fire with its healthful ventilation; but owing to the great loss of heat up the flue in the old style fire-place, few can afford to operate them with the constant advance in the price of fuel.\nWe are pleased to make announcement to the Home-builder, Architect and Contractor of a Fire-place Heater constructed with a Water-coil made of 30 lineal feet 1” charcoal iron pipe (not steel) being very durable. The coil is connected by pipes to ordinary Hot Water Radiators placed in any distant rooms; in this way the various rooms are heated with heat lost up the flue in the old style fireplace.\nThis Hot Water Fire-place Heater costs little more than an ordinary grate outside of the cost of the radiators, piping, etc., necessary, but this can almost be saved in fuel in one winter.\nIt will heat a medium size residence in a moderate climate.\nAs an auxiliary to a cellar hot water boiler it is invaluable in any climate.\nFor descriptive circular and price, write the\nHeitland Grate & Mantel Co.\nNo. 133 N.

C.\n\nOthers Discuss Some Timely Topics\n\nContractor Relieved From Loss.\nAn unusual experience is given in a New England paper, to the effect that a man who had made the low bid for a heating and ventilating system for a school building was released from his bond on the announcement that he had discovered an error in his figures which would lead to a loss. The matter was brought to the attention of the school board, and to the engineer in charge of the work, and after consideration the bidder was relieved of responsibility, the work being given to the next highest bidder, who was willing to carry out the work at the figures he had given.\n\nIf the school board had adhered to its rights, the original bidder would have had either to withstand a loss of over $1,000, or have given up the certified check for $400, which he had furnished as evidence of his good faith for carrying out the contract. This is far better disposition of the matter for all concerned than a custom too frequently followed by men who discover they have made an error and then endeavor to carry through the work in a way that will save them from loss, with the result that the finished work is by no means of the quality and character that was expected. Here the school board saved itself from the risk or possibility of having such an equipment provided, says Building Age.\n\nScientific Measurement System More Widely Favored.\nOne result of the European war has been to bring to both England and the United States a large number of foreign orders in which the metric system of weights and measures has been used. England has also had its attention more specifically centered upon the extension of its foreign markets for its own manufactures, and a difficulty is imposed in this respect because its measures of both physical things and currency are expressed at the present time in non-decimal standards. There is a growing movement in England to adopt the decimal system for both money and measurement.\n\nThe United States has not been so seriously handicapped in this respect, inasmuch as its money system has always been on the decimal basis. It has for many years had the opportunity to take a forward step in the matter of weights and measures in advance of the \"mother country,\" from which our practices in that field have been derived. It would appear now, however, as though we shall merely follow England in that regard. There is, however, an awakening interest in the subject in our own country. The National Wholesale Grocers' Association recently adopted a resolution recommending that the metric equivalents of weights be added in stating the weights of all package goods, says The American Lumberman.\n\nAsk for a Square Deal.\nCement Era thus editorially asks for a square deal for the building profession generally: Architects and engineers are professional men—at any rate, the good ones are. The architect is retained and paid for his services on the basis of fees, the same as collected by the doctor, the dentist, or the lawyer. He is often called into competition, but to compete with his ideas rather than with his prices on certain work. Consulting engineers operate on a similar basis. It is true that occasions have arisen wherein architects and engineers have gone into petty competitive building for small work, but fortunately this condition is not general and it is looked upon with disfavor by engineering societies and engineers prominent in their professional affairs.\n\nContractors, in a sense, are as much or more professional than engineers and architects. Architects need originality of ideas and ability to develop them. In most cases this is a result of special adaptability or a product of hard work. Engineers are likewise. Contractors are usually confronted with much more serious and complicated problems. Theirs are real problems of construction. It is for them to decide upon methods, overcoming sometimes seemingly insurmountable obstacles and in a way that will permit them to do their work at a profit.\n\nHundreds of contractors are doing work today with little profit or with profit entirely incommensurate with the amount of money invested and the knowledge and originality required. Why are contractors willing to cut prices just to get contracts? What is there in the contracting business which makes this necessary.\n\nA new era is in store for contractors, if the present tendencies are carried out in the coming years. Many railroads and power companies let their con-",

    "textTranscription": "tracts on a cost-plus-percentage basis. In so doing they select a contractor who has the ability, the money and the organization to perform the desired work in the specified time and the way it is desired to be done. The causes for low-priced contracts are not alone due to the contractors, but the blame is shared equally by the builders who have been poor buyers of contracts. In buying shoes, the ordinary person takes quality into consideration. He buys from a firm whom he knows to be reliable and from whom he knows the article he purchases will be exactly as represented. The same man, in buying a suit of clothes, selects the store where he knows he will be accorded fair treatment and will not be given a cheap article when he has paid for a good one. The same commonsense methods should be applied to letting contracts; and if they were in more general use, there would be less failure on the part of contractors, less unsatisfactory concrete work, and contractors would be regarded in a more professional light than at present.\n\nThe condition is deplorable, but will only be corrected by the contractors themselves refusing to take contracts at less than the legitimate profit due them for their knowledge and their more or less hazardous investment.\n\nThe Duty of the Hour.\n\nThe President speaks the will of the nation. He does it temperately, dispassionately, but with a convincing finality that leaves nothing to be desired. * * * American citizens of other nativities should do their utmost to respect the feelings of the German-born, and to help them in standing fast by their American faith. It is their hour of trial. They will come through it triumphantly, but they should have the sympathy and help of their fellow-citizens. * * * We are one people in the presence of this great moment in history, says the Minneapolis Journal.\n\nEstimating the Loss.\n\nThey are beginning to arrive at figures which show the loss of wooden buildings in the European war. It is the merest beginning as yet, but the light it throws on the situation is unmistakable, and it affords a sort of basis for estimating how much lumber will be needed to restore what has been destroyed. That phase of the case is of interest to lumbermen in America who are looking for export business after the close of the war.\n\nThe French Minister of the Interior has completed a tally of the buildings destroyed by the Germans in that part of France which they occupied during their dash for Paris, but from which they retired after a few days or a few weeks. That district is now in French possession-and the count of the loss of wooden buildings has been finished. The destruction amounted to 345,840,000 feet, about one-third of it being fine joinery work and interior finish. The invading army occupied that district a short time only. The wave of invasion rolled in and receded, but within that brief period the destruction of wooden buildings reached the enormous total given above.\n\nThe Germans still occupy a region of France nearly four times as large as that from which they have withdrawn, and the destruction there has been, from all accounts, more complete than that in the districts where their stay was short. Based on that estimate, considerably more than a billion feet of wood has been destroyed, counting buildings alone.\n\nBut France is only one corner of the devastated areas. As much or more has been destroyed in Belgium, a greater amount in Poland, while in East Prussia, Austria, and the Balkans the totals are enormous. It is doubtful if the whole exports of lumber from the United States to Europe in many years would suffice to restore what the war has destroyed in buildings alone, comments Hardware Record.\n\nThomas Jefferson, Architect.\n\nIt was all right for Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence, to revolutionize the laws of Virginia as to primogeniture, and establish religious freedom and create a feeling of tolerance among the people, but they were not proud that he was also a great architect.\n\nOn this point the Christian Science Monitor says: 'The truth is, neither in his time, nor for years afterward, were Jefferson's fellow-countrymen willing to dissociate him from his public achievements for any reason whatsoever. For his part in the framing of the Declaration of Independence, for his part in the making of the Constitution, and for his part in directing the government in its tender years, they were willing to grant him all praise, to do him all honor, but they could not become enthusiastic when told that he was an expert draftsman and had designed some very fine buildings. They even thought that it was beneath the dignity of so great a man to putter around with a trestle board, compasses, rules, crayons, and the like. Their idea of him was that he should devote his whole time to composing declarations, framing Constitutions or dictating essays on the fundamentals of democracy.'\n\nBut Jefferson's architectural work was as unhampered by established limitations as was his political vision. He designed the Virginia Capitol at Richmond, the graceful University of Virginia group and the mansion at Monticello, and these achievements have been admired for generations.",

    "textTranscription": "Southern Architect and Building News\n\nVOL. XXXIX. DALTON and ATLANTA, GA., MAY, 1917. No. 1\n\nTo Encourage More Home Building\n\nTHE nation-wide “Buy a Home” campaign that is being agitated by the executive committee of the National Association of Real Estate Boards promises to create additional outlets of lumber consumption that should draw the keenest interest of lumbermen. While the real estate men are no doubt actuated by their common desire to emphasize in the most impressive manner possible the growing values of realty, no development of land values can be accelerated without the improvements that are conferred through building activities.\n\nThe preparations made by the national association embrace direct home booming practically in every community in the country, and the individual members of the committee are located at the most desirable and convenient points. For the information of the lumbermen who will desire to identify themselves with this movement the names of the members of the executive committee are given here:\n\nHill Ferguson, of Birmingham, Ala., chairman; J. E. Morris, of Indianapolis, Ind.; Paul C. Murphy, of Portland, Ore.; I. F. Eppich, of Denver, Colo., and John S. Leslie, of Sharon, Pa. In drawing attention to the fact that the locations of the members are in the most promising parts of the country for the movement that is being advocated, the information is added that the territory which will no doubt be covered thoroughly by each member of the executive committee—with the assistance of the local realty boards—is particularly apt to respond quickly to the general publicity that will be used.\n\nBefore this countrywide campaign for the individual ownership of homes was started, similar movements were successfully carried out in large cities such as Birmingham, Ala.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Denver, Colo., etc., and proved to be remarkably effective in stimulating real estate purchases. To a great extent, lumber retailers in the cities here named also profited because there was a good sized increase in the demand for buildings, especially of wooden construction. The details of the “Buy a Home” campaign are as follows:\n\n1. Let the local Board endorse the movement and fix the dates, and appoint a committee of five to carry out the campaign. Get good, live committeemen who have enterprising and original ideas. The Board should determine the amount it wants to spend on this campaign. A very creditable one can be put on for $100.00. If there is no real estate board in your city, call an informal meeting of the real estate men and get them organized at least long enough to put on this campaign.\n\n2. Invite the local ad club, or if they are not organized, invite the ad men individually, to attend a joint meeting with the real estate men—or arrange for a joint luncheon to talk matters over. Explain to the ad men that there is no real prosperity in this country unless real estate is active, and that the architects, contractors, material men and furniture, wall paper, paint, plumbing and other such dealers are just as much interested in “Buy a Home” as are the real estate men. The ad men will help you wonderfully in this campaign.\n\n3. Have the whole committee, or a good subcommittee, go before the local Boards of Education, for the city and county, or the City or County Superintendents of Education, and urge them to have all the children in the public schools engage in some sort of contest in composition writing during or just before the “Buy a Home” campaign in May—such compositions to emphasize the desirability of home ownership. Of course the object of this is to educate the child along proper lines, and also to start the folks at home to thinking about Buying a Home.\n\n4. Have a local print shop get out several hundred yellow cards 14 inches wide and 22 inches tall with the phrase “Buy a Home” printed in red at the top of the card—“Buy” on the first line and “A Home” on the second line. These letters should be about 3 inches tall, and the two lines should take up the upper 9 inches of the card, leaving the lower 13 inches blank. Arrange with a local sign painter to visit the various merchants and print on the bottom of the card in black ink, some phrase applicable to the merchant’s own business—for instance: “Buy a Home and We’ll Stock the Pantry”—“and start a garden in the back yard”—“and we’ll give it that cozy look”—“and let us paper the walls”—“and we’ll supply the baby carriage”—“if you have the money; if not, get ready to buy a home by starting a savings account”—“and put your savings in a diamond”—“with the money you save trading at Woodworth’s”. You will find that the merchants show great ingenuity in getting up phrases to fit their",

Some of the larger stores will have their own sign painters use the phrase “Buy a Home” on every card they display in their show windows during “Buy a Home” week. Don’t use the name of the real estate board on any of these cards—keep the real estate end of the campaign in the background. The sign painter will charge about 20 cents each for getting out these cards.\n\n5. Get the street car company to put “Buy a Home” cards for the week on the front end of each car. If an advertising company controls the privilege, possibly you can afford to pay them, as it is excellent advertising.\n\n6. Have a quantity of yellow 6x6-inch cards with “Buy a Home” in red painted diagonally across on each side, and a hole punched in the upper corner. Insert strings and hang them on the radiator of every automobile you can induce to carry them during the week in question.\n\n7. Get busy at once with your electric light, water and gas companies, and they will print “Buy a Home” in red ink on their May bills. Take this up at once.\n\n8. At a cost of 15 or 20 cents each, you can have “Buy a Home” rubber stamps made for each real estate firm, and let them stamp each of their May bills with it. It can also be used effectively on letter heads and envelopes.\n\n9. Get all of your newspapers, daily and weekly, to write “Buy a Home” editorials, and get the reporters to show their ingenuity by writing attractive stories of the campaign.\n\n10. Get all the real estate men to do extra newspaper advertising that week, all of them featuring “Buy a Home” bargains and urging the advantages of home ownership. The newspapers will gladly run “Buy a Home” streamers across the top of the real estate page. The advertising solicitors can be of great assistance in getting up attractive displays.\n\n11. It would be very appropriate for the women’s clubs to talk “Buy a Home” during that week, especially as the women are nearly always the inspiration of home ownership.\n\n12. By all means get every real estate broker and salesman enthusiastic on “Buy a Home.” One of the best effects of this or any other advertising campaign is on the advertiser himself, and every salesman should have carefully planned just what he intends to accomplish during “Buy a Home” week. If the individual doesn’t put any thought or effort into the campaign, he isn’t going to get anything out of it. On the other hand, if he does put into it enthusiasm and intelligent study, we’ll guarantee good results.\n\nAugusta to Have Builders’ Exchange.\n\nA hundred and fifty men representing every line of building activity in the city of Augusta, Ga., met in an enthusiastic meeting recently for the purpose of forming the Augusta Builders’ Exchange.\n\nMr. Joe T. Lawrence of the McKenzie Building Company presided over the meeting.\n\nMr. T. T. Flagler of Atlanta, the state commissioner of the National Association of Builders’ Exchanges, made a most interesting talk on the work accomplished by the national association and told of its rapid growth in recent years. This association now numbers over 9,000 members in the United States. In his talk Mr. Flagler emphasized the fact that co-operation was absolutely necessary in the interests of the allied building trades were to be conserved.\n\nFollowing Mr. Flagler, Mr. Dan Carey, the secretary of the Atlanta Builders’ Association addressed the meeting and in a very pleasing way outlined the work of the Atlanta association. There were none present who were not convinced by his talk that Augusta stood badly in need of such an organization and a great deal of enthusiasm was aroused among the men present. At this point slips of application for membership were passed around largely signed by men who will be charter members of the new association. The membership in the association is open to all firms and individuals who are in any way connected with building.\n\nMr. F. E. Gibson of the Woodward Lumber Company spoke of the necessity of organization if the building trades of Augusta were to protect themselves. He endorsed the plan heartily and pledged the full support of his company. Short talks were also made by Mr. McNeil of the Whitney-McNeil Electric Company, Mr. E. J. Erbelding, and Mr. Brill of the Brill Electric Company.\n\nThe meeting was then adjourned to meet at a later date to organize and take up the question of the election of a secretary for the new organization.\n\nArchitects Coming to Atlanta.\n\nUpon the invitation from the Georgia chapter, the Convention bureau and others, the executive committee of the American Institute of Architects selected Atlanta as the next meeting place of their committee. After entertaining President John Lawrence Mauran at the convention of the Builders’ exchanges in February, Atlanta had no difficulty in securing the meeting. President Mauran has written Mayor Candler that the committee “is looking forward to the enjoyment of Atlanta’s matchless climate and hospitality.” The meeting will probably be held this month, and will attract about two hundred architects from the southeastern states.",

    "textTranscription": "The Work of Henry Hering\n\nAMERICAN sculpture with the figure of Rodin hovering over it, an evil genius, is as though it had been dipped in an acid that only age could rub off. There have been so many monumental figures in art, but no single, contemporary figure of any period so enormous as that of the great Frenchman. He is, as I have said elsewhere, a god or a monster. The great mass of sculptors either profit from the radiation of his light or are lost in the darkness of his shadow, writes Guy Pene du Bois in The Architectural Record.\n\n''Diana''—A Bronze Profile—By Henry Hering, Sculptor.\n\nRodin with the world, I am inclined to believe, is a realist. That may be because the present day interest in dollars is greater than the present day interest in art. Indeed it is the art market, the glamour of the fabulous sums spent in it, rather than the art product, that creates talk, excitement, admiration, envy among the people.\n\nNow unless art takes the reins and tugs on them one way or another we are going to be realists—that is, we are going to take life as it comes and comment upon it with all the literal truth of which we are capable. Not because the world is without natural idealists and symbolists, men with intuitive prejudices who would follow a path blindfolded despite temptations placed in a million by-ways, but because the vaster world with eyes glued on gold follows the practical man who may lure it with enough of the stuff that glitters. The practical collector of gold is a realist.\n\nPlace ideals instead of dollars, which for the simplification of the argument is not an ideal, on the pedestal, and immediately the heads of artists, who are individuals, will bob up definitely above the vortex; idealism becomes a buffer to realism; symbolism steals a little of the fire of literalism.\n\nIt is true that nothing lives that is not truthful, and likewise true that the range of truth is so vast that one end of it must seem very great truth and the other end very great falsehood. Now the modern realist who sees in truth an obvious theme are likely to call the idealist a liar, forgetting that truth, which is sincerity, lives in every man’s individual vision.\n\nHenry Hering, the sculptor, whom this article concerns, is not a realist, not a follower of Rodin, strange for the day, and one of the most sincere of the men here who feel that they have something within themselves worth giving out to the world. He was born in New York City in 1874. He began his studies at Cooper Union, worked for eight years with Martini and for eight years with Augustus Saint Gaudens. The latter connection was broken only with the sculptor’s death.\n\nIt would be futile and rather foolish to say that he had retained nothing of the teaching of these men, that he had discarded, with a shake of the shoulders, the veil thrown over every sincere student and stood forth an individual linked to no other individual by any trend of thought or any method of expression. He is Saint Gaudens over again, the workman and, in many little delicacies of conception, the artist. Here the influence may be said to rest and through it and above it stands Hering the individual, with his own grip on thought. A very distinct point should be made of this because it would be a very easy and a very natural thing to place him as a pupil of Saint Gaudens, in accordance with the tradition of the pupil and the master, and to let it go at that, and because I fear that it would be as great a mistake as to say all Republicans and all Democrats and all Socialists were sheep or that every soldier in a company was like his captain.\n\nHering works quite alone and rarely exhibits. In this he resembles the older sculptors whose work became familiar to the public only after it was placed in a public building or square or park a finished commission. He has made an ideal of dignity",

Mr. Freeman, being a typical New Englander, feared the thing that he could not understand, feared that possibly a fortune was to be made from settlers, who, strangers in a strange wilderness, became conquerers of it.\n\nThe theme of this work Hering carried out in a portrait bust of Augustus Saint Gaudens finished just previous to that great American's death, and never publicly exhibited. This Saint Gaudens' bust indeed, as a tribute to the famous artist, is unquestionably valuable. In the Metropolitan Museum of Art are two portraits of Saint Gaudens, one by mula, bad. I imagine that realists finding that the classic spirit regulated the realism would discover an ideal in it and cry falsehood. Mr. Hering, as a matter of fact, is too truthful to deny his eyes as the Academicians do and too sincere or too truthful to deny the ideal of beauty, which with him, as with any man, must color his sight.\n\nI believe that this ideal in Hering is dignity. A portrait bust of John Freeman, a New England farmer, which he showed to me recently in his studio, is to me the most direct expression, at least the most obvious expression of himself, or of his art, if you prefer it, that I can call to mind.\n\nThat Hering himself considered the execution of it important is certain.

    "textTranscription": "32 SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS\n\nKenyon Cox that follows closely an academic formula, and therefore must be valueless as a document, and one by Ellen Emmet, in which the literal facts concerning form, features, construction are made to seem, perhaps, over important as though the detail of a mole on a man's face was to be turned into a conclusive argument in the judgment of his character.\n\nHering points to the puny in minor details with big comprehensive truths. One finds them in his portrait of Bishop Talbot, of Southern Pennsylvania, and in his portrait of Roger Platt, the son of Charles Platt, the architect. In this latter portrait one sees not only the boy Roger, but an epic to the spirit of American youth. It is handled in much the same way that Praxiteles handled that head of Hermes, the smooth clearness of the face accentuated by the tumbled roughness of the hair.\n\nIndeed the spirit of the ancient Greeks is to be found often as not in the works of Mr. Hering. It is decidedly apparent, for example, in a little statuette of Venus, hands uphold a drapery that hangs in symmetrical folds, the proportions lending grace, the attitude, dignity, the almost frenzied coldness of the manipulation of flesh—the godlike purity of the Greeks, clear as air on a fine winter day.\n\nIt is the bronze Diana that Mr. Hering considers his masterpiece and in which he has made of reserve a fine art. That statuette shows a Diana new to modernity, a Diana that is really a goddess, free from earthly temptation, from material care, happy, joyous, but refined and as divine as though she were a goddess of Hering's own religion. He shows her in lines that are clear and continuous, sinuous and unhampered, devoid of prudery. Continuous line, but not too continuous, too suave, which, like urbanity, is vulgar.\n\nAnother picture of joy, less dignified, more youthful than the joy of Diana, that is ageless, is his figure, suggested by Milton's 'L'Allegro,' blowing through pipes similar to those of Pan and dancing, her face lighted, like her figure, by the joy of rhythmic tune and motion.\n\nA catalogue of Hering's work would be entirely inadequate if it did not include examples of his work in bas-relief. Here one may not forget that he was a pupil of Saint Gaudens who knew how to lend air and even color to a flat surface. His bas-reliefs reach a little fulled into the province of the painted picture. Their forms are a little fuller, a little more robust than those of Saint Gaudens. I am thinking of the bas-relief of Everts Tracy, the architect; of Charles Albert Coffin, the president of the General Electric, and of the group portrait of Alice Olin Dows and of Stephen Olin Dows. The last is captivatingly decorative. This may be said too of his medal for the Scarsdale Golf and Country Club, an arrangement of Scotch thistle, which it is possible he may win himself, as much of his spare time is devoted to golf.\n\nElsewhere in that catalogue designs for architectural motifs should be given a prominent place. In this field of his work the most apt examples are to be found in a lioness wearing the Egyptian headdress, seated, the lines of her figure rigid, her gaze impenetrable—a sphinx truly; in the terminals of the seasons now at the Harkness house of which Gamble Rogers was the architect; in the fountain of the boy and the dolphin in the Mather house, Cleveland, which Charles Platt designed, and in a beautifully arranged figure of Pan, the immortal, for the fountain of the Dows house at Rhinebeck, designed by Albro and Lindeberg—here is a strong feeling by the sculptor that his art is indeed allied to architecture.\n\nBuilders of Raleigh Organized.\n\nThe Raleigh Building Trades Association is a new venture launched at Raleigh, N. C., and one in which is represented over three hundred men in the building industry of Raleigh and vicinity. The following officers were elected: John Thiem, president; J. C. Murphy, vice president; W. T. Barrow, business agent.\n\nThe purpose of this organization is as in all trades organizations, for the benefit of the men engaged in the building trade. According to reports, there is a bright outlook for the new organization.\n\nForeign Trade Opportunities.\n\nWhere addresses are omitted they may be obtained from the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Washington, D.

Here he worked with Hildebrandt until the latter left Florence, but not before he had made lasting impressions upon Engelmann.\n\nThen the young sculptor met with Boecklein, a mature artist of many years, who for a long time had not used any model, carrying nature in his head and hand; he explained his version of plastic art and advised the young artist to study the antique, and to dispense with his model. Engelmann began this style of work before he had made a sufficient study of nature to be able to proceed without a model, with the result that his work was rejected by the jury in Munich.\n\nJust at this time, a German artist traveling through Florence, advised him to go to Paris, whither he went in 1896. After a short time at the Julian Academy he retired, depending upon his own resources to work out the way which no teacher could enlighten for him.\n\nSoon he succumbs to a new influence and Hildebrandt and Italy are entirely forgotten: in their place come Rude and Carpeaux and the younger artists, Dubois, Mercie and Damot. Paris enthuses over these, and Engelmann finds in them many things that appeal to him, such as realism in detail of form and impression and many plastic singularities.

After exceedingly serious study he produced, in 1906, “The Woman with the Gloves.” The face and hair are modeled with the simplest surfaces; the lines meet in severe angles and the broad sleeves which offered opportunity for a tumult of folds and carvings, are unmoved save for a few incisions at the joints modified by the horizontal position of the lower arm.\n\nPrevious to this, a sketch for “A Resting Woman” had been created. Engelmann happened to see a very sick woman with relaxed limbs just before her death, and he was so strongly impressed that he made his sketch, which an architect friend asked him to reproduce in stone for the garden of his mother in Osnabrueck. The three factors of the study, “The Woman with the Gloves,” the object of the dying woman and the commission of the architect, combined to form the turning point in Engelmann’s career; and in “The Resting Woman” Engelmann’s true self is revealed; from this time on his ways point toward mature works of beauty and greatness.\n\nWant Assistant Inspector of Engineering Material.\n\nThe United States Civil Service Commission announces an open competitive examination for assistant inspector of engineering material (aircraft), for men only. Vacancies occurring in the Office of Inspector of Engineering Material at Boston, Mass., Brooklyn, N. Y., and Pittsburgh, Pa., at $4.48 to $5.04 per diem, and in positions requiring similar qualifications at any navy yard or other naval establishment of the United States will be filled from this examination, unless it is found in the interest of the service to fill any vacancy by reinstatement, transfer, or promotion.\n\nThere are at present six vacancies, namely, one at Boston, two at Brooklyn, and three at Buffalo, N. Y., in the Pittsburgh district.\n\nIn filling vacancies certification will be made of the highest eligibles residing in the vicinity of the place at which the appointee is to be employed, except that upon the request of th department certification will be made of the highest eligibles on the register for the entire country who have expressed willingness to accept appointment where the vacancy exists.\n\nThe duties of this position will consist in requiring contractors to carry out plans and specifications prepared by the Navy Department for machinery and material used in connection with air planes for the United States Navy and passing upon tests of such machinery and material.\n\nCompetitors will not be required to report for examination at any place, but will be rated on the following subjects, which will have the relative weights indicated, on a scale of 100: (1) General and technical education, 40; (2) experience, 60.\n\nApplicants must be capable of preparing reports and of interpreting plans as presented in blue prints and specifications. They should have a thorough knowledge of the assembly and operation of gas engines in general and particularly of those types of engines used in air planes. They should possess particular knowledge of air craft and of the character of material which enters into air-craft construction, and should be familiar with the methods and processes used by manufacturers in air-craft construction.\n\nOne year’s experience as a machinist in a factory constructing gas engines for automobiles or air planes, or as an inspector of air-plane or automobile engines or one year’s actual experience in flying is a prerequisite for consideration for this position.\n\nUnder the first subject a rating of 70 per cent will",

It is reported that the native plumbers do not give satisfaction, probably due to the absence of modern methods, and that an American establishment with an attractive showroom of modern fixtures would doubtless meet with success.\n\n(The consul transmitted the name of a person in Bogota with whom interested persons may correspond, the address of whom can be obtained at the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce or its district or co-operative offices.

Their plans cover a series of extensive and exhaustive tests of the fire resistance properties of metal lath, its use in fire retarding construction, the exploitation to architects and the public of the saving in space which can be effected through the use of this material, its vermin and rodent proofness; investigation and assistance in the revision of building codes of cities so that metal lath will receive its proper recognition by city officials and engineers, and a co-operative movement in the distributing centers of the United States seeking to develop co-operative promotion work on the part of the jobbers and large distributors of metal lath.\n\nThe Advertising Managers who comprise the Advertising Council of the Publicity Bureau of the Associated Metal Lath Manufacturers are:\n\nMr. C.

    "textTranscription": "The Architect and the Community\n\nEVERY right-minded person feels a sense of pride in a beautiful, imposing structure which adds a harmonious note to its environment and causes the stranger within our gates to pause, stand still and admire.\n\nThe influence of such a structure, be it large or small, mansion or cottage, is deeper and more enduring than that of printed description or of glowing advertisement because it is more deliberately received, and itself is its own interpreter.\n\nIn the development of civic pride such an asset is no mere accident. It is the expression of both the artistic and the mechanical instinct and has a cultural value. Whether the structure adorns in stately fashion some corner on a busy, business thoroughfare, or whether as private home or municipal grouping, crowns in classic style some knoll of Nature’s handiwork hard by some scenic boulevard or lake front, or whether it graces rustic surroundings in some outlying suburb, if it is attractive in design, consistent with the purpose for which it was built, and durable in character, such a group bears an uplifting message to every beholder.\n\nAbout the first thing to which the attention of tourists is invited, upon their visit to any of the great cities of this continent or of the ancient capitals of Europe, is some historic building or grouping or architectural triumph which distinguishes that particular community.\n\nBut along before such a structure began to take visible form it existed first as an invisible idea, in the imagination of some master mind, although the multitude of details necessary to produce the finished product of that mind-image may never have been contemplated nor comprehended in the original source of the idea.\n\nSome one had to be able to estimate and assemble all the elements entering into the structure, each in its proper place and proportion. In this process it first took visible form in pencil sketches, skillfully drawn designs, accurately scaled and scientifically, as well as artistically proportioned. Here art and science were requisitioned to bring into completeness the structure desired to fulfill a great civic, inspired human purpose.\n\nNot an accident nor scintilla of chance in the whole scheme, but the demonstration of scientific skill belonging to but one profession, and of that profession one sees but little in public print. Like that of law and medicine, the architect’s profession is on a non-competitive basis, has its abode in the intellect, requiring years of education and special preparation along established standards, and consequently is never advertised in the commonly accepted sense of the term.\n\nBut the value of the architect is known and realized by every person who is wise in building operations. His advice is valuable concerning the property upon which you intend to build; in choosing the right spot for the structure, and even the real estate itself, which, under the improvement contemplated, is expected to yield profitable returns, is in many instances chosen solely upon the advice of an architect.\n\nHe understands how to translate the sun’s rays into cash value.

The architect was there as counsel for both owner and contractor from the very beginning until the structure was finished and in every respect ready for the purpose intended.\n\nThrough him you have the means of checking materials, whether provided as specified. If you have ever employed an architect you found that the plans which he prepared showed every detail of construction—every outlet for electricity, water, steam, etc., making it possible to get a group of contractors to give you closer and more definite bids, because it is only on plans showing every detail and full conditions that contractors can bid without guessing.\n\nYou found to your surprise that the architect furnished in addition to the working drawings and specifications, in spite of his small fee, a complete set of mechanical equipment drawings, showing the lines of all pipes for heating, lighting, ventilation, etc., also a complete set of engineering drawings, showing the location of every steel rod and every rivet hole for truss work.\n\nFurthermore, you found that every moulding and ornamental feature, both exterior and interior, was shown in full size drawings; that the interior had an individuality of finish which was pleasingly commented upon by everyone who entered the building; that the exterior had a distinct attractiveness which drew the attention of passers by, thereby becoming a self-advertiser and giving you a peculiar sense of pride in its ownership.\n\nYou found that the steam heating system did not have to be tampered with, nor the plumbing, nor the wiring, as they all worked perfectly, and as a consequence of employing an architect the building was complete, the arrangement of every detail of the plans fully up to your expectations, and the structure recognized by your tenants as being exceptionally convenient and attractive; that they took pride in living in it and speaking favorably of it to their friends—the most effective form of advertising there is.\n\nHas Professional Pride.\n\nYou found the architect a very honest fellow, who stood in a neutral position between you as owner and the contractor, to see to it that the structure was honestly, economically and expeditiously built; that when a just and businesslike contract was made no step was omitted nor taken with undue haste in the orderly procedure throughout this most complicated of all undertakings, the planning and construction of an effective building.\n\nFinally, Mr. Builder, you found by employing an architect who has professional pride in carrying out his part of the enterprise, that satisfactory results were obtained not only for yourself as owner, but for your contractor as well; that he treated both in a thoroughly professional manner, just as your doctor or your lawyer would do; that he refused to compete in the matter of his fee with other architects, a practice which would lead to demoralizing results in the form of imperfect service for which in the long run the public would pay, since the public has no way of gaining a knowledge of the profession, nor of informing itself as to what constitutes complete professional service with respect to the architect, and that he was worth the customary fee, if not many times more than that amount.\n\nA Six Hundred Car Garage.\n\nIn a giant garage just constructed in New York City, the exasperating delays often encountered in getting cars into or out of the aisle are eliminated, because the garage has no elevators and the cars are automatically spaced on the floors in such a manner that there is sufficient room for each one to run out into the aisle without disturbing the others.\n\nInclined concrete ramps take the place of elevators, each ramp being twenty feet wide, says the Popular Science Monthly. They are arranged so that one line of cars goes up while another line is coming down. There is a concrete curb in the center of each ramp, to restrict the lines of cars to separate paths, so as to prevent collisions between cars passing in opposite directions. Besides being a great convenience to the individual automobile owners, these two-way ramps will effect a saving of approximately $18,250 in annual overhead expense for the garage owner. The ramps from floor to floor of the four-story structure take up the same amount of room as elevators but the cost of building them is the only expense connected with them. It costs nothing to operate them when once built. The designer of the garage, H. B. Mulliken, of New York City, has calculated that the cost of each elevator trip is ten cents and that the average daily number of cars going up and down would be two hundred and fifty, making five hundred trips in all.\n\nAn Unbreakable Window Glass.\n\nA new glass, transparent, tough and strong, which a 22-caliber bullet cannot penetrate and a brick cannot shatter, is stated by Popular Science Monthly to have recently been invented. The secret of its strength is said to be a sheet of white, transparent celluloid, twenty one-thousandths of an inch thick, placed between two pieces of glass. The glass and celluloid are welded together under high temperature and tremendous pressure, the result being a solid sheet possessing the transparency of the best plate glass and the strength of a sheet of metal.",

    "textTranscription": "SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS\n\nCuring Auditorium of Echoes.\nThe auditorium of the University of Illinois was a veritable sounding board before its acoustic faults were remedied. Echoes and reverberations were so pronounced as to distress an audience. Various methods of cure were considered—the effect of padding and paneling the walls, the possible advantages of installing wires and sounding boards, and finally, the action of the ventilating system. These were all discarded in favor of padding the walls with sound-absorbing hairfelt.\n\nBefore the effective cure was found several methods of tracing sound were tried. One test was made by talking, through a megaphone toward different walls. The sound was generated inside a small house and its direction controlled by two megaphones, one being pointed toward a listener and the other toward a wall which gave echoes. No distinct echo could be obtained by speaking simultaneously into the two megaphones. The ticks of a metronome (a clock-moved pendulum for marking exact time in music) produced very little additional effect, but when a sharp intense metallic sound was tried, echoes were obtained from unpadded walls but only faint response from padded walls. The intense hissing sound of an arc light backed by a reflector gave more pronounced results. It showed that the padded walls produced a marked effect in reducing the intensity of the sound.\n\nBefore it was decided to use hairfelt as an absorbing material, curtains and draperies were hung at critical points suggested by the reverberating sounds. Four large pieces of canvas were suspended in the dome. From an acoustic standpoint the auditorium was in a much improved condition as soon as the curtains and draperies were suspended. Of course the architectural features of the auditorium forbade the continued use of curtains. Hairfelt was finally adopted.\n\nAccordingly, one large curved wall was covered with strips of one-inch hairfelt thirty inches wide, placed vertically and thirty inches apart so as to leave bare spaces between them. Following this the dome above the arches and the double curved side walls and single curved rear wall above the balcony were padded. The felt was mounted on thin furring strips which were bent to fit the curvature of the surfaces.\n\nSays Atlanta Needs City Planning Board.\n\"Atlanta needs a city planning commission to handle its development problems, traffic problems and plaza scheme,\" was the remedy suggested by Architect John Lawrence Mauran, of St. Louis, Mo., in Atlanta in February to attend the Building Exchange convention.\n\nHis subject before the convention was \"Co-operation Between Contractor, Architect and Owner.\"\n\"What do you think of Atlanta’s problems?\" was asked Mr. Mauran.\n\"There is no such thing as ‘Atlanta’s problems.’ What is one city’s problems is every city’s problems. The problems of Atlanta are likewise the problems of Seattle, Wash., and Portland, Maine. On the other hand, what is good for one city is good for another.\n\"Atlanta can handle its problems and provide for its future growth, 50 years hence, by having a city planning commission. In a few weeks I am to take before the United States congress a bill to make it compulsory upon every American city to have a city planning commission.\n\"It is the only sane, commercially economic and scientific way in which to handle a city’s growth and problems. Marseilles, France, has just recently, despite the war, torn down six blocks in order to put up more modern and handsome buildings in order that her city may be attractive enough to compete with other European cities after the war terminates. It is a commercial and economic consideration with the city planning commission.\n\"England has just passed a law making it obligatory that every English city and town have a town planning commission.\n\"Always, locally the idea of a city planning commission is unpopular with the city politicians. They point with scorn to it as a ‘city beautiful’ dream of architects.\n\"And so it is a dream! But what city can develop that does not dream? Every new idea has resulted from a dream. An ordinary citizen might walk across your Whitehall viaduct, every day in the year and see nothing but a horrible looking spot and plenty of smoke in the center of your city. But it took a dream like that of your local architect (Haralson Bleekley), to bring to the surface a scheme, now shown to be practical, whereby Atlanta may rid herself of this terrible eyesore disgrace in the center of your prosperous city.\n\"The city planning commission idea has long ago demonstrated its practical value to cities. Harrisburg, Pa., has secured wonderful results from it, as well as other American cities. It can no longer be called an idle dream of the ‘city beautiful.’ It is only beautiful in that it makes a city practical and more attractive to live in. And this is the great problem for all cities to study—that of making their cities more attractive for the people who live therein.\n\"By all means, tell your Atlanta people for me that they will profit multifold by having a city planning commission, and by building that plaza.\"\nMr. Mauran has had much experience in city planning. He was on St. Louis’ first city planning",

    "textTranscription": "44 SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS\n\ncommission, known as the \"Public Buildings' Commission.\"\n\nHis high position with the American Institute of Architects has carried him to all principal American cities, where he has studied their problems.\n\nGreensboro Builders Get Together.\n\nBuilders of Greensboro, N. C., including contractors for general construction work, architects and the specialists in various departments of building, had a meeting in late February. It was stated that the activity beginning or in prospect for the year in Greensboro and vicinity actuated the leaders who called the meeting to pursue the course.\n\nMany well known firms have headquarters in Greensboro, and they have done large contracts in various parts of the country, and now expect to make every effort to get the lion's share of the construction work in the booming home town. It is anticipated that several million dollars will be turned loose in the next two years for huge improvements here, and the builders are seeking to put themselves in position to give the utmost service.\n\nNew Things in Houses.\n\nWhen distinctive qualities embody character and promote comfort, an unusual residence fosters interest. That is the way with a small brick bungalow at Evanston, Ill., a house of swinging walls and disappearing rooms, that has amazed all who have examined it. It is a tiny, sun-flooded \"doll's house\" with light walls, white woodwork, and attractive, simple hangings.\n\nIts outside dimensions, not including the protuberances, are about 27 by 25 feet. Yet it is a five-room house with living room, approximately 13 by 25 feet in size; two bedchambers, about 10½ by 14½ feet and 10 by 14½ feet, respectively; a dining room, 10 by 14½ feet, and a kitchen, 7½ by 10 feet, as well as a toilet room, small hall, one very roomy closet, and a kitchen entryway which accommodates a refrigerator.\n\nSwinging walls are the secret of all this. The little house is really divided into a living room and kitchen. But only a trifle more time and energy are required in unfolding a fully furnished bedchamber, or a dining room, than attends the opening or closing of a door. The north walls of the living room—which are separated by a doorway opening into a small reception hall were hung on hinges and supported by heavy ball-bearing rollers. Firmly attached to the wall in the west half of the room, its legs reaching to within a half-inch of the floor, is a library table. On the other partition is a writing desk. Concealed behind the former wall are a dresser, chiffonier, and sewing machine. When this wall is swung back to form a bedroom, it fits the beamed opening extending from the hall doorway to the fireplace, and decreases the length of the living room to about 14 feet. A bed, to the foot of which a bench is attached, is then drawn out from the opposite wall. A doorway in one corner gives access to and from the other rooms.\n\nThe other—the east—end of the living room is converted into a dining room by a similar operation. When the wall in that half of the room is opened back and fastened in place beneath another beam, extending parallel with the first mentioned one, an attractive built-in china closet is disclosed, and a real dining room provided. Obviously, at such times the west end of the main room becomes the living room.\n\nRadiator on New Lines.\n\nA French concern has recently placed on the market a new type of radiator especially adapted to hot-water heating systems, which is much smaller than ordinary radiators and, in proportion to its size, gives off more heat. It is made of several coils, or sections, in the usual way. They are, however, wider from front to back than common coils, and so shaped that the sides of the radiator as a whole are marked by deep horizontal depressions. Extending diagonally from front to back are a series of partitions between the coils which serve to throw the warmed air out into the room instead of allowing it to rise straight up. The result of this arrangement is that the upper portion of the radiator is surrounded by air that is no warmer than that around the lower portion, and so its entire surface is put to use to heat the maximum amount of cool air. This form of construction, it is claimed, makes possible a saving of fuel.\n\nHouse Built on Steep Slope.\n\nA dwelling, which almost seems to hang on the side of a steep cliff, is an unusual architectural feature found not far from San Francisco. The west front of this peculiar house faces a street which is nearly 100 feet higher than the street on which the east front faces. For a dwelling of the ordinary type this almost perpendicular lot would be practically valueless, but in this case the architect has skillfully adapted the now popular Pueblo Indian style of architecture to the precipitous cliff and has produced a pleasing effect. The materials used are stucco and concrete. From the upper windows a magnificent panoramic view is obtained of the greater part of San Francisco, the bay, the cities across the bay, and the mountain range beyond. On the lower side retaining walls and shrubbery have been employed to good advantage to break the abrupt aspect of the slope. Steps mount to the entrance on this side, by easy inclines.",

Putnam, which we are pleased to reproduce because of his wide popularity in this territory:\nEdward Jeness Putnam, the new GF waterproofing manager for the Southern GF Co., of Atlanta, Ga., was born in Cleveland, Ohio, some time prior to the Spanish-American war. As a boy he started working in an architect’s office and intended making architecture his life work. However, he soon found himself in an engineering school in Cleveland studying civil engineering. This did not last long, for the call of architecture was too strong to resist, and he entered the building game, where he has been ever since. He has handled various lines and occupied various positions—from “Knight of the Road” to the “sales manager’s throne.” He has been manager of the supply department of large building organizations. For the past ten years he has been promoting and performing missionary work throughout the South for various lines of building products. He has put several new products on the map in virgin territory, which is only small evidence of “Put’s” ability. By his genial manner, vast knowledge of Southern building conditions and his spirit of helpfulness, he has made a wide and valued acquaintance among architects, engineers and contractors. “Put” has many nick-names. Throughout the South he made “Kore-Lock” famous and next to “Put” he is most widely known as “Kore-Lock” Putnam—the man with the iron jaw.” For the past four years he has been connected with Trus-Con Laboratories as district director. At present, as stated in the beginning, he is with the Southern GF Co., of Atlanta, Ga., as manager of the GF waterproofing department for nine big southern states. Mr. Putnam will have complete charge of GF waterproofing in Southern territory. He is exceptionally well fitted for this particular work. The General Fireproofing Co. already has an enviable reputation for quality in this line and the addition of Mr. Putnam will assist materially in placing GF waterproofings, concrete hardeners and wall coatings in this territory. His thorough knowledge of waterproofing conditions, together with his reputation as an eminent authority in his line give him good welcome among all architects and engineers throughout the South.\n\nEdw.

    "textTranscription": "SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS\n\nCrumb’s New Cattle Stanchion.\nCrumb’s Warriner Patent Chain Hanging Cattle Stanchion, manufactured by Wallace B. Crumb, at Forestville, Conn., are the best stanchions of this type manufactured. It is fully covered by patents in both United States and Canada.\nThey have recently improved the form of the bolt used in fastening the frame together. In the sectional drawing shown in their ad the bolts are continuous, passing entirely through the frame and secured on the outside by nuts which effectually prevent any racking or twisting. This improvement renders Crumb’s Stanchion an even more effective and durable device than heretofore, although it has always possessed these qualities to an admirable degree.\nIf you are contemplating the erection of new barns or the refitting of your present stables, by all means investigate this fastener before purchasing. If you have been getting along with an inconvenient old style affair, it will be to your interest to use Crumb’s Stanchion in the place of those you now have. You will find it will greatly add to your own convenience, be a considerable saving in time and labor, and materially add to your income by increasing the comfort and cleanliness of your cattle, thereby increasing the flow of milk.\n\nModern Water Closets.\nThe modern architect or builder knows that through the selection of the materials for his contract, that it is either helping to make or break his reputation. Usually the low costing article receives more attention and use than costlier merchandise. An illustration of this point is in a comparison of water closets against the higher priced marble surroundings.\nInvariably the water closet will receive more use than the marble, its function is to give service and to afford better sanitary methods for the modern construction.\n\nThe unsuccessful operation of the gravity flushing closets, both from the standpoint of sanitary conditions, due to insufficient water pressure for the proper cleansing of the bowl, and the various methods of control resulting in a noisy, troublesome combination prompted Mr. H. C. Bowlus, founder of the Bowlus Mfg. Co., of Springfield, Ohio, to conceive the Bowlus “Famous” and “Jewel” flush valves.\nThe “Famous” direct flush meter, is designed primarily to render entire satisfaction and service. It is so designed as to eliminate all noises, troubles and other disadvantages.\nThe “Famous” has an adjustable end base that can be guaged to throw any amount of water that is desired to a flush, depending entirely upon the requirements of the building owner. This valve has been on the market for the past several years and is now entering into what promises to be one of the most successful years in its history. This valve is also designed so as to fit any manufacture bowl. This is for the purpose of replacements of the “Famous” on remodeling contracts. As there are instances where the old bowls can be fitted with this valve and made to give many years more service. A one inch water supply is all that is required for the “Famous” and it roughs in at nine or more inches.\nThe Bowlus Company, also manufacture the “Jewel” compression tank water closets, which have been extensively used in all parts of the world. This combination has proven very popular as a school, factory or public service closet.\nBoth combinations are fully guaranteed for five years. Should any reader desire information they may obtain same by addressing the Bowlus Manufacturing Co., Springfield, Ohio, and giving credit to this publication.\nAmong the water closet installations made in this territory are the following: Greer, S. C., schools; Great Falls, S. C., Republic Cotton Mills; Parkersburg, W. Va., Masonic Temple; Glenpool, Okla., schools; Boyles, Ala., High Schools; Birmingham, Ala., Atlanta, Ga., schools; Lavonia, Ga., courthouse; Winder, Ga., Jefferson, Ga., schools; Perry, Fla., St. Augustine, Fla., Houston, Texas, Port Arthur, Texas, Arthur, Texas, schools, and many southern states.",

    "textTranscription": "SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS\n\nA New, Economical, Practical and Reliable System for Regulating Elevator Service\n\nOTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY\nDALLAS, TEXAS\n\nFebruary 11, 1916.\n\nMr. A. G. McNabb, Manager,\nCommonwealth Building,\nDallas, Texas.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have examined the electric floor indicator and supervising system which you recently had installed in the Commonwealth Building, and I am writing to express my appreciation of the efficient manner in which it is working. I wish to bring to your attention the fact that not only is your building one of the first to have installed the electric floor indicator and supervising system, but also that the installation is a complete success and has worked satisfactorily from the start. The operators are afforded a clear view of the position of their cars at all times, and the floor indicators furnish a means of communication between the manager's office and the operators.\n\nI believe you have an excellent equipment, and wish you the greatest success with same.\n\nYours very truly,\nC. H. Schmitt\n\nCLB-JBC\n\nThe fact that an elevator operator is the only one who knows the traffic condition in the shaft above the first floor, and of his particular condition of load, the responsibility of giving efficient service is dependent upon his cooperation with the passenger and manager.\n\nTo equip each car with a small cabinet in plain view of the operators, containing a row of electrically lighted indicators, each light representing a floor. The movement of any car will illuminate a number in each cabinet corresponding with the floor position of the car. This apprises the operator of the relative position of all the cars. Therefore, should a car get out of position, a distress signal provided can be set up in the pursuing car, signifying that due to unavoidable delays the signalling car must withdraw temporarily from service and depend on the signalled car to serve the floors passed up so that the proper running order may be adjusted.\n\nIlluminating the position of his own car renders unnecessary the display of numbers formerly used on the landing. Concealing the landing numbers from the view of the passengers compels them to announce their stops promptly, enabling the operator to save the loss of time and expense of over-running a landing.\n\nOur system provides the manager's office with means of communication and information as to the location of all cars in the building, and each car separately, therefore furnishing a complete check on the performance of each operator.\n\nThe installation consists of a simple wiring plan, without the use of coils or magnets, or any other mechanism that is likely to get out of order, neither does it require any adjustment or cost for maintenance.\n\nOur method of regulating elevator service has been approved by some of the best authorities on elevators and elevator service, and by all who have been interested in knowing the results obtained from its use.\n\nIllustrating a 3-car installation in an 8-story building, Car No. 1 first floor, Car No. 2 4th floor, Car No. 3 8th floor.\n\nFurnished by\nWAKEFIELD & McNABB,\nDALLAS, TEXAS\n\nFebruary 11th, 1916.\n\nMr. A. G. Schmitt,\nDallas, Texas.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have tested the signal system for elevators in the Commonwealth Building of this city and find the following results:\n\n1. The operators are kept informed of the location of all cars at all times.\n\n2. Any means of knowing of the location of the three elevators by passengers is removed.\n\n3.

The front is of Colonial design, cast iron heavily plated, which is fitted with a door for convenience in lighting without danger of being burned. It was constructed to be used in the regular wood partition, or tiled over the rear of the bathroom and is set 5 inches above the floor air register, and 14 or 18 inches from the floor.\n\nThe heater is odorless, as the flames come in contact with nothing but air, thereby eliminating asbestos and other artificial substances which are used to mask unpleasant odors. The complete construction is such as to make it entirely free from smoke, which would usually mar the finish of the room and its furnishings; it mixes down the floor through the room and passes up over the radiators, and the heat from the gas heater is distributed evenly over the entire room. It is the only heater of its kind that can be used in the bathroom without any fear of fire or explosion. It is the only heater that can be used in the bathroom without any fear of fire or explosion.

Our system of manufacture is founded on the theory that concrete for a building block should be of the highest possible quality—that means that it should have sufficient moisture to make it “pour.”\n\nMacArthur blocks are poured in low-cost metal molds. When they have hardened sufficiently, they are released and stored for aging. When they have cured, they are flint-hard and ring when struck with a hammer.\n\nMacArthur metal molds for molding MacArthur blocks are easily assembled and easily cleaned. You can start with a few molds and add to your equipment as your business grows.\n\nYou will have no competition for your product. Architects and Builders will specify your blocks immediately upon seeing them.\n\nWe sell our equipment to only one plant in a town. Write for our proposition before some other concrete man starts manufacturing MacArthur blocks.\n\nMacArthur Cement Products Co.\n102 N. Main Street\nBurlington, - - - Iowa\n\nUSE THIS COUPON\n\nOne Type of Wall\nHere is one type of block made in our molds and laid in the wall. Our molds also manufacture block for silos, and the best silo you ever saw.\n\nSend me without obligation, full details about MacArthur System of pouring concrete block, also address of nearest user.\n\nMcFELL INDUSTRIAL FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS\n\nare noted for lowest maintenance and operation cost ever obtained.\n\nMcFell’s is a reliable fire alarm system with the highest possible percentage in operation efficiency.\n\nThe McFell system provides a circuit which will continue operative, as under normal conditions, while subject to troubles which would suspend service on other systems.\n\nIf a tree or a chimney fell upon the wires of the old type system, breaking them, or through some accident to a box on the circuit, if the circuit was open and the current ceased to flow, the protected feature would be entirely lost and the district covered by the said circuit would be without fire protection during such a period of time as the line was undergoing repairs. If this accident were to befall the McFell System no such condition would exist. Each box on the circuit would continue to turn in its proper alarm, as before, and the apparatus, gongs and other equipment functioning under normal conditions. It is at once apparent, therefore, that no question or doubt can exist as to the difference in efficiency between the old style loop circuit and the McFell metallic loop circuit, and while we are in a position to furnish the single loop circuit, to those who insist upon this character of apparatus we do not recommend it, and we would advise strongly against the use of the same.\n\nEstimates gladly furnished for hotel, factory, warehouse, store or residence systems.\n\nWrite for our booklet entitled “Fire Alarm Apparatus” It will tell you more about McFell Fire Alarm Systems.

    "textTranscription": "The Editor's Annotations\nIS YOUR WORK WORTH MORE THAN 10%?\n\nALMOST over night there has arisen along the architectural horizon of the South a faint but easily perceptible cloud, not sufficient within itself perhaps to cause any alarm or materially affect the welfare of southern architects. However, if the velocity of the wind should increase it is likely that a situation will come up whereby the whole fabric of professional ethics in the matter of fees for architectural service might have to undergo a rather painful operation. Unless some step is taken before many moons have passed over southern skies to prevent this condition coming to pass, we venture the assertion that the dark cloud will be over us long before we are safely entrenched within our storm cellars.\n\nDame rumor has been whispering into our editorial ear quite persistently recently of foreign architects coming into the South and grabbing off big commissions that rightly belonged to southern architects, and what's more we are given to understand their clients are boasting of the fact that they had to pay their architect more than ten per cent. This does not sound so good to say the least, when we happen to know that about the best an architect practising in the South can do is six to eight per cent on commercial work and eight to ten per cent on residential jobs.\n\nThere may be a few architects scattered throughout the country who are practising architecture purely for the love of it but you can count them on your two hands and eliminate the thumbs altogether. This leads us to remark that if these fellows can come South from the East and West and do their work just as satisfactorily as southern men can do and still pull a higher commission fee from their clients then more power to them. Our observation over a period of years is quite convincing that the work done by local architects in cities throughout the South stacks up equally as well, and in more cases than not, better than work done by foreign men when you come right down to brass tacks and make comparisons in cost and satisfactory performance of the completed buildings. Then, we would like to know why some sophisticated southern people will go out of their way to submerge themselves to a building they have to pay a higher per cent on when the same work can be done for less than ten per cent? There seems to us to be three answers to this question—either southern architects are not receiving a fair price for their services or foreign architects are being overpaid—the third answer might insult the intelligence of somebody's client so we will refrain from making further comment.\n\nThere is a great amount of outside capital being invested in the South today and perhaps it is natural that architects from the East and West where these investing organizations have their home office should be given first consideration and entrusted with the design, plan and erection of their buildings in the South. We wonder some time if these capitalists really do consider the economic factor involved in engaging the service of an architectural office which is entirely unfamiliar with climatic conditions, the labor situation and existing material prices in the South. We are firmly convinced from certain experiences which have been brought to our attention that should a comparison be made of the ability of southern architects and that of architects from other sections to produce a given building with a given sum of money, the southern men would stand out head and shoulders above their foreign brothers. This is no reflection on the architects from the East or West but it is a simple matter of being familiar with certain conditions that do in reality influence to a great degree the actual cost of the finished structure.\n\nWhy is it that quite often when an eastern or western architect secures a job in the South a southern architect or architectural firm is named an associate? It is because that client or that architect realizes that it is good economy to do so. We happen to know of an instance where the southern associate insisted on changing the specifications by his eastern colleague and by doing so saved the client twenty thousand dollars on a single item. We also know of several cases where the architect requested his southern associate to write the specifications acknowledging that he had no earthly idea as to how it should be done to meet certain conditions that existed here in the South. And mind you these instances which we have cited are shortcomings of two of the leading architects in the East. It is sad but true that the associate architects on these works received only two per cent while the architect up East collected a very nice four per cent.\n\nIf foreign architects can secure a larger per cent for their service here in the South it looks like southern architects could do likewise. It's about time southern architects were acting as architects and not associates on the big work.",

    "textTranscription": "SOUTHERN ARCHITECT and BUILDING NEWS\nVOLUME 55 JULY, 1929 NUMBER 7\nA Restoration Problem\nBy Mary Rolls Dockstader\nLevy & Clarke, Architects\nAn architect seldom comes in contact with a client whose appreciation and judgment of the qualities of a really fine old piece of architecture is sufficient to warrant him encouraging rather than discouraging its duplication for present day use. In the case of the house which Levy & Clarke recently completed for Mills B Lane, Esq., at Savannah this unusual circumstance was encountered by the architects.\nThe work of the architects in handling this problem is of more than passing interest. Whether you find your inspiration in the classicism of the eighteenth century or in the modernism of the twentieth, you cannot fail to be sensible of the beauty and grace of this restoration. Dignified and refined, with its white stucco walls, green shutters, well balanced fenestration, a perfectly scaled portico and interesting Palladian window, facing as it does the tropical beauty of Forsyth Park it stands as a living tribute to the good taste of its builders and will perpetuate a work of architecture, noble in itself, that no doubt will soon be swallowed up with the encroachment of commercial buildings.\nThe problem presented the architects was to duplicate as near as possible the old house on Abercorn Street which is known familiarly to Savannahians as the “old pink stucco” house. To more fully understand the significance of the architects problem and that you might better appreciate the results as you see them in the illustrations of the Mills B. Lane house, a brief history of the original example from which the architects had to work should prove of interest.\nThe lot upon which the “old pink stucco” house now stands was sold in 1771 by Joseph Clay for six hundred and fifty pounds, the lot being sixty by one hundred and eighty feet, to James Habersham, Jr., the son of the James Habersham who came to Georgia in 1737. The senior Habersham was Secretary of the Province, and acting governor during the absence in England of Governor James Wright in 1771. He was also a partner in the first importing and exporting firm of Savannah, in which business his son, James junior, followed him.\nIt appears that James Habersham, Jr., did not immediately build on this property. At the time of building the house, the records show that Joseph Clay built it and financed it for James Habersham and that up to 1789 no brick buildings stood on the lot, but there is evidence of some frame structures. Mr. Habersham evidently built beyond his means as the court records tell us. Clay levied on the east half of the lot and the brick building thereon in 1789. So it is well established that this house was not actually built until shortly before 1790. In 1800 the house was bought at public sale by Hester Habersham, widow of James, Jr., for $2,300. In 1802 Thomas Willing acting for the United States Bank bought the property for $9,000, and it was again bought in 1811 by the Planters’ Bank of Savannah for $15,500.\nA description of the original house will give you a clear idea of the fidelity with which the architects went about their work.\nIt is constructed of smooth stucco over brick, two stories above a low basement, and without dormers. There is a chimney at either end of a stepped gable, and quoined corners. The doorway is unusual —instead of the customary six or eight-panel door this one has a greater number of small, square panels, with fanlight above, and a lattice design at either side formed of narrow mouldings. Above the doorway, and lighting the second-floor stair landing, is a handsome Palladian window. There is a fairly large Doric portico with wrought-iron railings between the columns, formerly surmounted by a graceful white balustrade. This must have added a pleasing touch of lightness to the building’s otherwise plain exterior.",

LANE HOUSE, SAVANNAH, GA.\n\nThe addition to the north side occupies the site of the former garden, while the ugly cornices over the windows were added in late years.\n\nIn the restoration in the new building, every exterior dimension and detail was duplicated to the smallest fraction of an inch. In the rebuilding of the main spiral stairway, fragments of the original were on the walls and the first floor, the outlines of which were all carefully followed. The iron work is an exact replica and every slab of marble in the portico was carefully measured and reproduced. One of the greatest problems was the restoration of the stucco to imitate the original. Analysis of the original showed that it was made of lime and sand, the lime being procured from the pulverizing of oyster shells. The sand was of an unusual pearly color. In the restoration this old “Tabby” was carefully produced so as to obtain the original color and texture.\n\nThe house is now occupied by Mr. William Murphey, the president of the Citizens & Southern Bank.",

It was the happy hunting ground of a former nation and of the early settlers along the South Atlantic Seaboard. Today we find lodge houses of many of the country’s best known sportsmen nestling here and there in the wooded forest.\n\nIn this area lies Gregory Neck Plantation, the hunting preserve of Bayard Dominick of New York. Coming in from the Coastal Highway, through miles of woodland over an old plantation road, the scenery is picturesque and beautiful. Small white boarded cabins with mud chimneys, rest serenely among the live oaks, these homes of tenant farmers add interest to the picture.\n\nAt the end of a broad open field which rolls be-\n\nPhotos: By Tebbs & Knell, Inc., New York City\nENTRANCE DETAIL, BAYARD DOMINICK SHOOTING LODGE",

    "textTranscription": "46\nSOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS\nJULY, 1929\n\nyond the forest, the lodge house is seen amid a ca- thedral of green and gray. The whitewashed brick walls and graceful columns are strongly contrasted with the wonderful old live oaks, magnolias and camellias.\n\nApproaching the house the road takes a wide bend, giving the visitor a full picture of the winding river beyond the house, the golden marsh land and pine woods across the stream. The superintendents' cottage, stables and kennels add to its completeness. The house is located almost on the exact spot, where some two hundred years ago one of the earliest man- sions was erected. Nothing remained of the old home but the foundations, composed of huge Eng- lish brick used as ballast no doubt for sailing vessels in the earlier days.\n\nWith such a background the architect's problem of selecting a style for Mr. Dominick's lodge house was already determined. The house is in that style of Colonial and Georgian Architecture so character- istic of the Southeastern States in the early days. Simple and sturdy lines depending entirely on mass and proportion for its impressive effect. The main portion consists of the two-story porch, entrance hall, dining room and living room with an open terrace on the river side. On the second floor in the center are the owner's bed rooms. There are two subordi- nate wings, one houses the guests while the other wing is taken up with the service. These wings are placed at such angles that sunlight can be had to the maximum advantage in every room.\n\nWithin the house there is an atmosphere of sim- plicity, a feeling of quiet and restfulness, freedom from cares and the responsibility of many servants. A simple Colonial stairway is the feature of the wide hall extending through from porch to terrace. The living room is most pleasing with its low ceiling, deep set windows and attractive mantel with book shelves on either side. Huge bricks from the foun- dation of the house have been effectively used for mantel facings in all rooms. The dining room, gun room and bed rooms are all unpretentious, comfort- able and livable. Such rooms you always found in the fine old houses erected in those good old days when servants were no problem and prohibition no issue.\n\nREAR VIEW, BAYARD DOMINICK SHOOTING LODGE",

    "textTranscription": "House of Gilman Prichard, Augusta, Ga.\nBy E. Lynn Drummond\n\nMANY years ago when Augusta's residential district was that section now known as down town, long before winter resort hotels or a winter colony were thought of, a number of her wealthier citizens built summer cottages on the sand hill to the west to escape the heat of the valley. Many of these cottages still stand, surrounded by beautiful gardens and quaint picket fences, have been modernized, kept up, and are now the center of the city's fashionable life. The type has an atmosphere of its own, an atmosphere of hospitality, and so when the Gilman Prichards of Concord, Mass., bought a little patch of wooded land on Cumming Street just back of Milledge Road and named it \"The Woodlot,\" this type was selected as the inspiration for the new house.\n\nPhotos: By Tebbs & Knell, Inc., New York City\nENTRANCE TO HOUSE OF GILMAN PRICHARD, AUGUSTA, GA.",

    "textTranscription": "70 SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS JULY, 1929\n\nOn the site, almost hidden by the trees stood a little four-room cottage. Some say it was all of a hundred years old. This cottage was made the service portion of the house, the master’s portion being built in front of it. The two buildings were joined by two covered passages and the space thus inclosed was turned into an inside garden or outdoor living room.\n\nThe old cottage type presented a difficulty, in that the low sweeping roof allowed insufficient space for second story bedrooms, so while the general detail was adhered to, the roof was given the Dutch gambrel form, not out of harmony at all, for curiously enough, a number of old Augusta houses show a strong Dutch influence.\n\nIn the design of the house the trees were made a vital part of the composition. At one point a wall of one of the connecting passages has been deliberately built around a large oak, the same thing happens twice at the front terrace wall, while another tree, with a bench around it, grows up through the east terrace pavement. It was necessary to remove only two trees, both small ones.\n\nThough in general the freshly painted, kept up appearance of the old cottage type has been preserved, the walls of the inner court show an interesting treatment best described as antique: whitewashed brick. Genuine old brick were used, and the whitewash was not paint, but real whitewash, made durable by the addition of salt, alum, and molasses. Mortar joints were hosed down while green, lightly at the top, more toward the bottom, washed back in some cases as much as an inch. The whitewash was applied thick. When still wet it was stained with dry color, beginning at the ground, gradually fading out several feet up; the color, raw and burnt sienna, burnt umber and light blue, applied with a wide brush and blended out to simulate weather stains. After about half an hour the wall was sprayed with a hose till patches of the half set whitewash fell away, showing the brick. The spraying was heaviest near the ground. The whole operation was repeated several times, the final effect being that of a wall that had been whitewashed, weatherbeaten, whitewashed again, again weatherbeaten, and so on through the years.\n\nIn the treatment of the interior authentic Colonial mouldings and detail were used throughout. Mr. Prichard’s study is 17th century, the walls all of beaded boards stained to simulate old unfinished wood. The living and dining rooms are of a later period, the woodwork enameled in soft ivory and the walls papered. There are no ceiling fixtures. All the lighting is by floor lamps, and a few old-fashioned sconces.\n\nEARLY AMERICAN ROOM IN HOUSE OF GILMAN PRICHARD, AUGUSTA, GA.",

    "textTranscription": "Southern Architectural and Industrial Arts Exposition\n\nAnnouncement of Medals to be Awarded\n\nARCHITECTURE is an assembly of all the arts. By a joint exhibit of drawings and photographs of buildings executed, also of the products of the arts and crafts and building materials, all of which enter into the completed work, the public will better visualize the successful consummation of the architect’s conception. In this exhibit the industrial arts in their various forms, decoration, furniture, textiles, sculpture and paintings should play an important part.\n\nThere is no more potent method of placing before the public the importance of the architect’s function, than by showing the extent of the field drawn on by him to produce the building which we admire in its completed state. Architecture is truly “the mother of the arts” and this exposition will demonstrate that truth.\n\nThe arrangement of the exhibit has, as its focal point, the drawings and photographs of executed work; and around this will be grouped the exhibits of the manufacturers whose products have made our buildings successful. The Court of Honor forms the crossing of the two avenues of architectural exhibits. In this space, open to the exhibits of architects only, it is hoped each member of the profession will be fully represented by reproductions of his best work. Perspectives, models, studies of detail either in the form of sketches or photographs, in fact as varied a selection of documents as we can collect should be assembled in this exhibit. Enlargements of photographs are a splendid medium for presentation. Details of the requirements for exhibits will be distributed later.\n\nWe are producing, in the South, some of the most worthwhile architectural work of the country, and now is the time to let the public know it. There is no more convincing method of showing this than by placing reproductions of our work on view, and we believe that this exposition is the ideal method of proving what we know to be a fact. A great many of us have been so busy producing that we have overlooked the duty that we owe to ourselves of showing our work to the public in such a way that they will realize the authorship of the work.\n\nAround the architectural exhibits will be grouped the exhibits of industrial art, all exhibits arranged in architectural setting. Surrounding these will be the exhibits of building materials and mechanical appliances used to make the buildings beautiful and useful. The manufacturer of building products is daily becoming more aware of the value of art. The cry of the degradation of art by the machine is being discounted more and more as beautiful product follows beautiful product on the market. To the architect this will be one of the most instructive and enjoyable parts of the exhibit.\n\nThe whole scheme of arrangement of the exhibition is planned to stress the importance of architecture and show to the public what effort the architect expends in behalf of his client.\n\nAs an evidence of the interest in this exposition a number of medals have been offered. The method of award and the juries who will make these awards will be announced in circulars of information which will be sent to all Southern Chapters of the American Institute of Architects and to all architects practicing in the South as far as it is possible to reach them. The following medals have been announced to date. Mr. Walk C. Jones of Jones and Furbringer of Memphis, offers a gold medal for the best individual exhibit. Mr. Tebbs of Tebbs & Knell of New York, offers a medal in memory of Mr. Neel Reid of the former architectural firm of Hentz, Reid & Adler of Atlanta for the best exhibit of domestic architecture costing under $20,000.00. Mr. Henry E. Harman, Jr., offers a gold medal in memory of his father Henry E. Harman founder of the “Southern Architect and Building News” for the best domestic architecture costing over $20,000.00. The Southern Architect and Building News offers a gold medal for the best public work and another gold medal for the best mercantile work. Mr. Milton S. Biswanger of Biswanger & Company, glass manufacturers of Memphis, offers a medal for the best ecclesiastical work.\n\nIt is planned to make this exposition one of the outstanding cultural events in the South. The President of the American Institute of Architects has promised to be present at the opening which will be formal and by invitation only.\n\nThe success of this exhibit depends on the efforts of all. It cannot be put over by a few. Let each individual member of the profession do all in his power to make his the outstanding exhibit and we will show the world what we know in our hearts to be true that the work of Southern Architects is the “ne plus ultra” of architectural achievement.\n\nBAYARD S.
