The top half features a large bordered ad titled 'ATTENTION ARCHITECTS!' in bold uppercase serif font. Below the title is a black-and-white photograph of a tall, early 20th-century skyscraper with a pyramidal roof, identified as the Union Central Life Insurance Building in Cincinnati, Ohio. To the right of the photo is text promoting 'Wolf's Elastine Lacquer,' a floor varnish, with detailed claims about its durability and resistance to moisture, ammonia, and chemicals. A list of references follows, naming various buildings and hospitals across multiple U.S. cities. The manufacturer's name, The Leon L. Wolf Paint Company, is prominently displayed at the bottom.\n\nThe lower left quarter contains an ad for 'An Improved Convertible Level' featuring a detailed illustration of a precision surveying instrument with knobs and a patented axis. The text explains its use for architects, builders, and contractors, emphasizing ease of conversion and patented technology. The company name and address, New York Blue Print Paper Co., are at the bottom.\n\nThe lower right quarter is an ad for 'DEFIANCE SUPPLIES' with a bold, large uppercase title and a small illustration of a classical warrior figure holding a shield and sword, labeled 'DEFIANCE QUALITY.' The ad targets architects, engineers, and artists, promoting blue and black prints, lithographic reproductions, and compo-board. The company name, Defiance Mfg. Company, and contact information in New York City are at the bottom.
