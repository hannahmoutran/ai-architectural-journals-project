The addition to the north side occupies the site
of the former garden, while the ugly cornices over
the windows were added in late years.
In the restoration in the new building, every ex-
terior dimension and detail was duplicated to the
smallest fraction of an inch. In the rebuilding of
the main spiral stairway, fragments of the original
were on the walls and the first floor, the outlines of
which were all carefully followed. The iron work is
an exact replica and every slab of marble in the
por-
tico was
carefully measured and
reproduced. One
of the greatest problems was the restoration of the
stucco to imitate the original. Analysis of the orig-
inal showed that it was made of lime and sand, the
lime being procured from the pulverizing of oyster
shells. Ihe sand was of an unusual
pearly color. In
the restoration this old “Tabby” was carefully pro-
duced so as to obtain the original color and texture.
The house is now occupied by Mr. William Mur-
phey, the president of the Citizens & Southern Bank.
