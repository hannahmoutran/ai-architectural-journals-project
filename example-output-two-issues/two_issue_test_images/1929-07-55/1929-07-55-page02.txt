KING
TANK HEATERS
are ideal for
hot water supply
On only one bucket of coal a day, the
King Tank Heater heats all the water needed
by a large or small family. The strong, com-
pact construction gives it years
of life. The
low first cost becomes almost negligible when
prorated on a yearly basis. It
requires a min-
imum of attention. It can be used anywhere
in city, town or country—in hot, mild, or
cold weather. The heat of the stove is un-
noticeable in the basment or kitchen—it all
goes
into the water. That’s the secret of King
economy. You should have full information
on this Tank Heater. Write for it today.
