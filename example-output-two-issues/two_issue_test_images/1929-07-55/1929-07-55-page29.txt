H ouse of Gilman Prichard, Augusta, Ga
By E. Lynn Drummond
MAN\
years ago when Augusta’s residential
district was that section now known as down
town, long before winter resort hotels or a
winter
colony were thought of, a number of her
wealthier citizens built summer cottages on the sand
hill to the west to escape the heat of the valley.
Many of these
cottages still stand, surrounded by
beautiful
gardens and quaint picket fences, have
been modernized, kept up, and are now the center
of the city’s fashionable life. The type has an at-
mosphere of its own, an atmosphere of hospitality,
and so when the Gilman Prichards of Concord,
Mass., bought a little patch of wooded land on Gum-
ming Street just back of Milledge Road and named
it “The Woodlot,” this
type was selected as the in-
spiration for the new house.
