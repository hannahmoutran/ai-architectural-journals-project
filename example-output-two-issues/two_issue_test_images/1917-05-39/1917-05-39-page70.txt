Eight Thousand Gallons of
Percoproof Were used for
Waterproofing the Cincinnati
General Hospital “Buildings ::
APPLIED
with a brush direct to foundation walls, concrete construction, masonry, or stucco surfaces, Percoproof
forms an unbroken, elastic facing that fills every pore and crack and prevents all seepage and moisture from
penetrating. Unlike ordinary waterproofing materials, Percoproof contains no oil and requires no thinning. It
comes ready for use and is equally satisfactory in all climates and at all seasons. Write for our damp-proofing booklet*

The Finger-Cling
Patented Bond Anchor for Brick Walls
THE
Finger-Cling bonds every course, including
the outside course, to the joists and frame of
the building. It fits flat between courses. Note
how the fingers cling to the heart of the wall. Mortar
hardens in the loops, making the bond part of the
wall. The Finger-Cling bond is light and easily
handled, but has enormous tensile strength, being made
of fine steel. Made flat and with right angle twist, so
that they may be used on the top or sides of joists.
Much cheaper than any other bond, and more effective,
because they bond every course. Specified by leading
architects; used by best
builders. Write for" list of
users, prices, and terms.
