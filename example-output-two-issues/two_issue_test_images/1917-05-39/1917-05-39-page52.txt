The making of pipe and fittings
for warm air heating plants is our
entire business. For years we have
been devoting all of our time and
study to this work.
That’s why Meyer products are
known from one end of the land
to the other as the most dependa-
ble and economical—why we can
save you time and money on your
furnace installations—why pipe
and fittings bought here cost less
than the ones you make in your
own shop.
Meyer’s Nested Furnace Pipe
is but one of the many time and money saving products
that our line puts at your disposal. We carry every
conceivable style and size of pipe or fittings required when
installing a modern heating plant.
