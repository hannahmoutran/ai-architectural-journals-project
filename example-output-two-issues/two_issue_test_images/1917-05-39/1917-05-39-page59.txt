Fig. 1.
Figure 1 shows the hanger as embedded in concrete.
Figure 2 shows the perspective view of
hanger, also showing nut to which the rod or bolt is
attached and the adjustment feature. The rod or bolt can be made rigid at any point of adjust-
ment desired.
The insert is fastened to form or false work by wire nails on either side bent over at the
top or by bolting direct to the nut which is placed within the adjustment chamber, removing the
bolt when taking down forms.
It’s a simple operation and the hanger proposition is solved.
Thousands in use.
Owners, Architects and Construction Engineers specify them.
Made in four sizes, for
7/16, y 2, % and 3
