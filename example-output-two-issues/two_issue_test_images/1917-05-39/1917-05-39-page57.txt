Another “Wolff” Success
Some people have every worldly
comfort, except the CLIMAX!
READ WHAT REV. THORESON, CANADIAN, TEXAS, HAS TO SAY:
Canadian, Tex.,
Dec 2.9, 1914.
The Taplin-Bice -
Clerk n
Co.,
Akron, O.
Gentlemen:
Permit me to say a
word In behalf of the
CLIMAX FUBNACES.
First, however, I wish
to say that I have acted
as Foreman and Sup-
erintendent in the erec-
t'on of one of the
largest and finest
churches in our city,
at a saving of $2,000
aside from a big sav-
ing on our furnace
which we purchased
from you.
A local concern off-
ered to sell us a fur-
nace for $250 and to
furnish registers, cold
and warm air p
; pes,
and install it for a l'ke
sum, making $5OO, plus
freight.
So you see we saved
over $3OO on our fur-
nace. I had no trouble
install ng the CLIMAX. All we had to do was to put it together. I
did the work myself with the help of a Tinner one day, and Carpenter and
one Laborer two days. It cost us $35 to install it.
But best of all, it does the work. The church is not only well pleased
hut proud of it.
I wish to thank you for your promptness and honest dealings with us.
Yours
truly,
H. W. THOBESON, Minister.
