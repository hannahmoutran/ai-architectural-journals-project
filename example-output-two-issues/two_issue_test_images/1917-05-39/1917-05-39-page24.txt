An Ideal Factory —
and an Ideal Roof
THE
modern manufacturer floods his workrooms
with sunshine, and his workmen keep in better
health and do better work. Here is one of these fac-
tories. It is built in the most modern and scientific man-
lier and is covered with a Barrett Specification Roof.
This is not to be wondered at. The wonder
’would be if some other type of roof had been
specified, because most of the permanent
structures of the country are covered with
-Barrett Specification Roofs.
This preference is due to the fact that such
roofs cost less per year of service than any
other kind; that they are free from all main-
tenance expenses and, further, because they
are guaranteed for twenty years.
In addition, Barrett Specification Roofs take
the base rate of fire insurance and are ap-
proved as “Class A” construction.
This combination of 20-Year Guaranty with
low cost and low insurance rate has put these
roofs in a class by themselves.
