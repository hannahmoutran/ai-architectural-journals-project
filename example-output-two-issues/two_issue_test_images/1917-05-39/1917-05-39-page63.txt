Temperature Regulation Made Practical
One prime requisite in any temperature regulation device is that it shall
operate for the laymen as surely as for the engineer.
Powers Regulators, whether a system or a unit, are noted for simplicity and
dependability. They are built with quality-thought first.
There is a specific Powers Regulator for every ordinary requirement in the
automatic control of air and fluid temperatures. The fundamental Powers
principle is practical and comprehensive. Powers Regulators can be adapted
for any
unusual or difficult conditions.
Let us help you solve your problem. Our thirty years’ experience in this
one line ought to help.
