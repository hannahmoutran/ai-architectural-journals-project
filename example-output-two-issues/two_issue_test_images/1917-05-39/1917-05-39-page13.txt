Trade Mark Registered.
The Perfect System for suburban homes, schools, and develop-
ments, with or without running water.

bottom and are thoroughly waterproofed to prevent seepage. They
require no cleaning out, no chemicals; are flyproof and odorless.
They employ the L. R. S. or two-tank principle of sewage dis-
posal, which was devised and is recommended by the United States
Public Health Service.
Many Architects and Contractors specify “SANISEP” Tanks, be-
cause they are recognized as being the solution of the sewage
dis-
posal problem for building beyond the reach of municipal sewer
lines.
