THE ALL-STEEL BODY OF
THE IMPERIAL
Warm Air Furnace
is rolled from a single steel plate and securely fastened by a single
row of rivets. The top and bottom are also formed from single
steel plates and riveted to the cylinder, forming a boiler without
any opening or cast iron connections.
The All-Steel Body of IMPERIAL WARM AIR FURNACES has
less riveted joints than
any
other steel warm air heater. Its heavy
construction allows a
greater heat to be generated without damaging
the IMPERIAL WARM AIR FURNACE. Its All-Steel construction
also causes it to radiate heat better than either cast or wrought iron
warm air heaters.
Absolutely gas
and dust tight.
No asbestos
packing used.
A steel furnace is especially well adapted for moderate weather.
As long as there is a hot coal of fire within the furnace, the Imperial
continues to radiate the heat, while with a
great many furnaces,
especially a cast iron construction, it requires the burning of more
fuel and more fire to get results.
Dealers all over the country are selling more All-Steel warm air
heaters
every day. The reason for this is that the superior All-Steel
construction of warm air heaters is rapidly becoming known to the
public. Our illustrated circular will convince you of the excellence of
IMPERIAL ALL-STEEL WARM AIR FURNACES.
