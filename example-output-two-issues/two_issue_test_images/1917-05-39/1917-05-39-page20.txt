SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS
Safety,
Simplicity
and
Economy
These are the basic principles
of scientific and practical
building construction today.
The safe column must com-
ply strictly with the building
laws. It should transmit
loads in a direct line, doing
away with shearing strains.
It should be easy to handle.
KEYSTONE
Cast Iron Columns
Comply with these requirements and offer you
many new and interesting features. They are
equipped with the Keystone Combination Col-
umn Cap, which is self centering with due pre-
vention
against eccentric loading. Made with
one, two, three and four-way brackets. The
lugs are easily altered to suit beams of different
depths. The illustration above shows a
two-way
bracket with lugs to accommodate beams of
different depths.

A point to rema

income
this mon h
Here’s an opportunity to make bigger profits for
yourself—a Chemical Closet which you can sell to home
builders with a profit at a less price than the wooden
privy.
ECONOMY Chemical Closet
The world’s best. A sanitary indoor closet which
can be set
up in the best room in the house —positively
kills all germs and
odors. It does away f
with the outdoor privy,
'
and the NU-WAY gives
comfort and conven-
ience where there are no
sewer connections.
AGENTS WANTED
We want one live con-
tractor or builder in
each town to act as our
agent. Good profits on
your sales. We assist
you to sell them.
The Economy is in great
demand. Hundreds of
homes have installed
them this winter. Write
today for catalogue and
complete details.
