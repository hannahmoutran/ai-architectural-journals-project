HERE, just off the press, is our comprehensive new
catalog, picturing and describing in full detail
D-I
Heating and Ventilating Specialties
For Schools, Hospitals, and Other Public Buildings
D-I Specialties have won the unqualified endorsement of architects and heating
engineers, and perform faithfully the following important functions:
1. They introduce from without the buildings sufficient quantity of pure
fresh air to meet all requirements:
®
2. They warm this air in the course of its admission.
3. They automatically give it the proper degree of humidity— without
attention whatsoever on the part of the operating engineer.
4. They diffuse this pure, warm, humidified air to every nook and corner
of the room, without drafts.
Our catalog explains in detail how D-I Specialties perform these functions, and why the D-I sys-
em is the most efficient and most economical ever devised. It also contains tables and extensive
data on
temperatures, air changes, evaporation, and percentages of humidity conducive to good
health and efficiency, and other valuable reference data. A copy will be sent gladly to
any
architect or heating engineer who requests it.
