HOT WATER COMMON SENSE
We want every Architect to become acquainted with and be a friend of the
ECONOMY BOILER DISPLAY IN BUILDING MATERIAL EXHIBIT
INSURANCE EXCHANGE BUILDING, CHICAGO. Economy Automatic Combination Boiler
and Gas Water Heater.
Your clients will long remember and appreciate the cir-
cumstance that you recommended it to them and specified it
for their use.
The ECONOMY AUTOMATIC solves the domestic hot water
problem. It renders complete hot water service and no other
hot water device does this. It is absolutely safe and dependable
and its service is constant day and night, 365 days in the
year, without any attention whatever from the owner, landlord,
tenant or janitor, and at a cost to operate which is so low every
one can afford it. The ECONOMY AUTOMATIC first cost is
modest. It is not a complicated piece of machinery in any re-
spect and it never gets out of order. It requires no special
meter and no special gas
service pipe direct from the main.
It keeps an ample supply of hot water constantly ready and if
the piping in the home or apartment provides for hot water
circulation the hot water from the ECONOMY AUTOMATIC is
always at the faucet ready to flow out HOT. There is no time
lost in draining cold water from the pipe before the hot water
comes.
During the winter months the ECONOMY AUTOMATIC
serves as the boiler for the hot water heated by the regular
house heating system and during this period there is no need
to operate the ECONOMY with its gas burning equipment.
A suitable sized ECONOMY AUTOMATIC BOILER installed
in the Residence, Bungalow, Two Flat or Three Story Apart-
ment Building will render this absolutely complete hot water
service 24 hours each day on a gas consumption of 4 to 5 feet
per hour. We guarantee the ECONOMY AUTOMATIC in every
feature —material, workmanship and service—and we
will stand
back of every one installed.
SWEET’S CATALOGUE. 1916 edition, devotes two pages to
ECONOMY BOILERS, giving list prices, specification size sug-
gestions, etc.
May we ask you to be careful to specify the ECONOMY
REGULAR when you turn out plans calling for Gas Heating
Range Boilers for kitchen installation? The ECONOMY REG-
ULAR is the best gas heating range boiler made. The Economy
Regular is non-automatic.

Ball Seal Traps
F. E. CUDELL
of
Cleveland, Ohio.
manufactures a
Trap
made with a Sinking Ball
Valve and also having a
Water Seal and large
water way. The ball
seals in the absence of
water, and is therefore
preferable to floating ball
seal or water seal only.
It is the only trap fit for
rooms
occasionally unoc-
cupied, as all traps are
liable to lose their water
seal 'in such cases. The
cover is readily removed
and the inside easily
reached. The trap is
made of lead, except the
dome and cover, which
are of hard white bell
metal, heavily threaded.
The ball used in the
trap is made of non-cor-
roding metal, and being
perfectly smooth, does
not accumulate filth. The
inlet sizes are from 1 to
iy2 inches and outlet
from IVi to 2 inches.
Catalog will be sent by
the makers
upon request.
CUDELL’S ANTI-
SYPHON TRAPS
Are absolutely non-sy-
phonic; were publicly
tested in Elmira, Roch-
ester, Gloversville and
Watertown, N. Y., and
Springfield, Mass. They
are simply constructed,
easily handled and ex-
cellent in every respect.
