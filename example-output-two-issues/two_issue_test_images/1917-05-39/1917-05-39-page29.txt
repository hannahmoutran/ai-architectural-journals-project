mula, bad. I imagine that realists finding that the
classic spirit regulated the realism would discover
an ideal in it and cry falsehood. Mr. Hering, as
a matter of fact, is too truthful to deny his eyes as
the Academicians do and too sincere or too truth-
ful to deny the ideal of beauty, which with him, as
with any man, must color his sight.
I believe that this ideal in Hering is dignity. A
portrait bust of John Freeman, a New England
farmer, which he showed to me recently in his stu-
dio, is to me the most direct expression, at least the
most obvious expression of himself, or of his art, if
you prefer it, that I can call to mind.
That Hering himself considered the execution of
it important is certain. He spent three
years getting
the old farmer, who is past eighty, to pose for him.
During this time he was forced to push his wit to
the extreme of effort in almost every
direction. Mr.
Freeman, being a typical New Englander, feared
the thing that he could not understand, feared that
possibly a fortune was to be made from settlers,
who, strangers in a strange wilderness, became con-
querers of it.
The theme of this work Hering carried out in
a portrait bust of
Augustus Saint Gaudens finished
just previous to that great American’s death, and
never publicly exhibited. This Saint Gaudens’ bust
indeed, as a tribute to the famous artist, is unques-
tionably valuable. In the Metropolitan Museum
of Art are two
portraits of Saint Gaudens, one by
“L’Allegro”—A Bronze by Henry Hering.
“Diana”—A Bronze by Henry Hering.
