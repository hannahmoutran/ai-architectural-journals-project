MORE MONEY
Concrete contractors are rapidly adopting the POLK SYSTEM of circular
monolithic concrete construction. Why ? Simply because the POLK SYSTEM
machine builds concrete grain storage, coal bins, water towers and silos at
high speed and at minimum cost. POLK SYSTEM EQUIPMENT MEANS
MORE MONEY, STEADY WORK, AND BIGGER JOBS. We have a very
attractive proposition for the contractor who wishes to get hold of the paying
jobs. Write for it today.
