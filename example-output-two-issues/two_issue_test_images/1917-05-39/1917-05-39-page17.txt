| “Trouble-Saver Scaffolds” |
=
Pay for themselves from the money saved on the first two jobs. E
E Did you ever figure up the money you lose in building old wooden scaffold- §
I ing; the nails and lumber wasted, and your
men’s time lost (a half day in E
I most cases) ? E
E Compare this expensive method with the slinging of the “Trouble-Saver”
E Scaffolds. No nails to drive—no bothering with bolts or screws. The “Trouble- |
E Saver” is simply hooked around a studding. Ten minutes’work. E
E And the “Trouble-Saver” won’t break; can’t slip; stays absolutely rigid
= until taken down. =
| We are offering a 30-day Free Trial to carpenters just to prove that these
|
| Scaffolds are really an investment.
