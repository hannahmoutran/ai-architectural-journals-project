AT
HIS DESK in an office, Richard
Englemann, a
twenty-three-year-old bookkeeper, began to cre-
ate plastic forms of various descriptions. Life was
so very monotonous that something had to be done
for amusement and recreation. In this
way Engle-
mann modeled small wax figures without any special
thought of sculpture. Some of the work, however,
of this amateur found its way to Ruemann, and not
long afterwards
Englemann became a student at the
academy.

Richard Englemann, the son of a doctor, was now,
at the age of twenty-four, entering upon the career
of a sculptor. Only half a year after entering the
Academy, about 1893, his first large work was creat-
ed, the “Philosopher,” a mature head of very com-
plicated surfaces. It appeared to be the work of
an advanced artist and would be considered a begin-
ning only by that
young sculptor who was striving
for more than the untrained
eye would be able to see;
to him sculpture must display ideas.
This first tvork met with success at the exhibit.
