The lOWA Batch Mixer
has unusual features—
investigate.
Don’t judge this machine by
the picture of it. It is a
mixer built on an old prin-
ciple that has never oefore
been applied to the mixing of
concrete. The machine is
ideal for concrete product?
plants, is a money-maker for
concrete contractors and when
put to mixing mortar, will
keep a gang of brick masons
busy.
Built in three sizes, 3,5,
and 7 ft. Mounted on skids
or trucks —with or without
power. Ask for circulars.
