First Aid to Sick Heating Systems
“It is never too late to mend” water-logged, air-bound or noisy steam heating
systems, with the
Lytton Thermo Syphon Trap
Just try it on the most hopeless old steam heating installation you
know of,
and watch results. It is entirely automatic in operation. Connect it
up to any
one-pipe or two-pipe system and the Lytton Trap will do the rest.
Here is what the Lytton Trap Does:
Collects and automatically discharges direct into boiler all conden-
sation as fast as it forms, irrespective of the pressure or vacuum.
Releases all air and non-condensable
gases
without loss of vapor.
Discharges returns from below water line into the boiler.
Eliminates pumps, receivers, air relief tanks and boiler pits.
Prevents “hammering,” flooded or air-bound radiators and burning
of boilers.
Assures perfect circulation and even distribution of heat.
Install the Lytton Trap on
your
new work as well as old. It will
help you
to win the confidence and
selling influence of
your trade. Write
for Bulletin No. 1 4 and for our
Special Agency Proposition. There
is still some desirable territory
open.
