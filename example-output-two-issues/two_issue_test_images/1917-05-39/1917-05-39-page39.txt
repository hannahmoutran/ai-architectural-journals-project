SOUTHERN ARCHITECT AND BUILDING NEWS 41
What time the grass upon the hills
Feels touch of Spring and thrills,
Then down the wooded slopes of gray
Peeps out a mass of whitened spray,
For through the leafless glen one sees
The glory of the dogwood trees.
The scent of blossoms fills the air,
A new world’s gladness everywhere,
Taking one back to long-ago,
When life wT as sweet and soft and slow;
Yet all the splendor of the day,
With touch of blue so far away,
No gladder sight the watcher sees
Than glory of the dogwmod trees.
Ah, me! how memory turns about,
Scanning the past from in and out.
The Carolina hills once more
I see as from another shore,
Where she and I on days like these
Did pluck from off the dogwood trees
The matchless blossoms, soft and white,
Each one as tender as the light
Of Love which answered in her eyes,
And made for me my paradise.
—From “I i Love’s Domain.”
