The use of concrete for road and street construction is :
increasing rapidly throughout the country. :
The experience of those communities which have built ■
concrete highways has proven beyond question that j
concrete not only gives the most substantial construe- z
tion, but also solves the perplexing question of main- :
tenance because ■
Concrete Practically Eliminates Maintenance.

DURABILITY
XXth Century Furnaces have been manufactured
for 22
years.
Wherever they have been installed they
are still in use.
After all, it is
the evidence
of the user
that is the
final test.
Here is what
Wm. S. Jes-
sup, R. F. D.,
F r i e ndwood,
Indiana, has
to
say:
“We have
used our XXth
Century Fur-
nace for 20
years.
WE HAVE
NEVER
SPENT A
DOLLAR on
the UPKEEP
outside of buy-
ing three
smoke pipes.
They did not
burn
out, but
rusted out;
our cellar is
damp. ’ ’
The XXth Century saves money
in fuel and re-
pairs and pleases the user.
“In the end a XXth Century is the cheapest and the
best.”
