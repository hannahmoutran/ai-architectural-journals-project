“Better Than Marble”
Kitchens Make Clean Inviting Rooms
A kitchen in which Vitrolite is in-
stalled will be a
joy forever to the
mistress of the home because dirt or
du6t can
instantly be detected on its
beautiful, smooth, white surface and
be removed quickly and easily with
soap
and water. A vitrolite kitchen
will always look clean, wholesome and
sanitary.
Vitrolite has a rich, deep color like
statuary marble; is very hard—non-
porous
and acid proof. It cannot be
stained nor will it discolor. It has a
wonderful surface that is as enduring as
&one and looks like that on the finest
Dresden China.
Let us tell you more about our
material and its uses.
