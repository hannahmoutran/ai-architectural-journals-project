A New, Economical, Practical and Reliable
System tor Regulating Elevator Service
OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY
DALLAS. TEXAS
February 11, 1916.
Mr. A. C. McNabb, Manager,
Commonwealth Building,
Dallas, Texas.
Dear Sir:-
I have examined the electric floor
indicator and supervising system which you
recently installed in your building in Dallas,
and am
pleased to say that I was
favorably
impressed with this device. When you have
thoroughly perfected the system I believe
you will have filled a long felt want on the
part
of the
building manager.
The fact that an elevator
operator is the only one
who knows the traffic con-
dition in the shaft above
the first floor, and of his
particular condition of
load, the responsibility of
giving efficient service is
dependent upon
his co-
operation with the
passen-
ger and manager.
1 have noted the elevator service
in
your building both before and since the
installation of this
equipment, and have noted
a
marked
improvement. It no doubt has the
effect of
forcing the passengers to call their
floor numbers when
they enter the car, and
also .by furnishing a check on the operators
insures better service on their part.
I believe you have an excellent
equipment, and wish
you the greatest success
with same.

Yours

To equip each car with a
small cabinet in plain view
of the operators, contain-
ing a row of electrically
lighted indicators, each
light representing a floor.
The movement of any car will illuminate a number in each
cabinet corresponding with the floor position of the ear. This
apprises the operator of the relative position of all the cars.
Therefore, should a car get out of position, a distress signal
provided can be set up
in the pursuing car, signifying that due
to unavoidable delays the signalling car must withdraw tem-
porarily from service and depend on the signalled car to serve the floors passed up so that the proper
running order may be adjusted.
Illuminating the position of his own car renders unnecessary the display of numbers formerly
used on the landing. Concealing the landing numbers from the view of the passengers compels
them to announce their stops promptly, enabling the operator to save the loss of time and expense
of over-running a landing.
Our system provides the manager’s office with means of communication and information as to
the location of all cars in the building, and each car separately, therefore furnishing a complete
felieck on the performance of each operator.
The installation consists
of a simple wiring plan,
without the use of coils “

likely to
get out of order,
neither does it require any
adjustment or cost for
maintenance.
